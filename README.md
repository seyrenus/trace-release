### 2024-11-16T13:37:15Z [**alebeck/boring**](https://github.com/alebeck/boring)

```
* Adds glob pattern matching for specifying tunnels, e.g. `boring open "dev*" "prod[12]"` * Adds -a/--all flag for opening and closing all tunnels * Adds support for "+", "-", and "^" algorithm modifiers in SSH config, this led to problems in recent macOS versions * Minor improvements  **Info for updating**: When updating, the daemon of the previous version could still be running. So it might be necessary to kill it using `killall boring` before using the new binary. If you update via Homebrew, this is done automatically.  **Breaking changes**: We now disallow certain tunnel names, which you were probably not using anyway. This includes tunnel names containing spaces or glob symbols "[?*", or those that start with a special character.

## [0.4.0] - 2024-11-19  ### Added  - **👥 User Groups**: You can now create and manage user groups, making user organization seamless. - **🔐 Group-Based Access Control**: Set granular access to models, knowledge, prompts, and tools based on user groups, allowing for more controlled and secure environments. - **🛠️ Group-Based User Permissions**: Easily manage workspace permissions. Grant users the ability to upload files, delete, edit, or create temporary chats, as well as define their ability to create models, knowledge, prompts, and tools. - **🔑 LDAP Support**: Newly introduced LDAP authentication adds robust security and scalability to user management. - **🌐 Enhanced OpenAI-Compatible Connections**: Added prefix ID support to avoid model ID clashes, with explicit model ID support for APIs lacking '/models' endpoint support, ensuring smooth operation with custom setups. - **🔐 Ollama API Key Support**: Now manage credentials for Ollama when set behind proxies, including the option to utilize prefix ID for proper distinction across multiple Ollama instances. - **🔄 Connection Enable/Disable Toggle**: Easily enable or disable individual OpenAI and Ollama connections as needed. - **🎨 Redesigned Model Workspace**: Freshly redesigned to improve usability for managing models across users and groups. - **🎨 Redesigned Prompt Workspace**: A fresh UI to conveniently organize and manage prompts. - **🧩 Sorted Functions Workspace**: Functions are now automatically categorized by type (Action, Filter, Pipe), streamlining management. - **💻 Redesigned Collaborative Workspace**: Enhanced support for multiple users contributing to models, knowledge, prompts, or tools, improving collaboration. - **🔧 Auto-Selected Tools in Model Editor**: Tools enabled through the model editor are now automatically selected, whereas previously it only gave users the option to enable the tool, reducing manual steps and enhancing efficiency. - **🔔 Web Search & Tools Indicator**: A clear indication now shows when web search or tools are active, reducing confusion. - **🔑 Toggle API Key Auth**: Tighten security by easily enabling or disabling API key authentication option for Open WebUI. - **🗂️ Agentic Retrieval**: Improve RAG accuracy via smart pre-processing of chat history to determine the best queries before retrieval. - **📁 Large Text as File Option**: Optionally convert large pasted text into a file upload, keeping the chat interface cleaner. - **🗂️ Toggle Citations for Models**: Ability to disable citations has been introduced in the model editor. - **🔍 User Settings Search**: Quickly search for settings fields, improving ease of use and navigation. - **🗣️ Experimental SpeechT5 TTS**: Local SpeechT5 support added for improved text-to-speech capabilities. - **🔄 Unified Reset for Models**: A one-click option has been introduced to reset and remove all models from the Admin Settings. - **🛠️ Initial Setup Wizard**: The setup process now explicitly informs users that they are creating an admin account during the first-time setup, ensuring clarity. Previously, users encountered the login page right away without this distinction. - **🌐 Enhanced Translations**: Several language translations, including Ukrainian, Norwegian, and Brazilian Portuguese, were refined for better localization.  ### Fixed  - **🎥 YouTube Video Attachments**: Fixed issues preventing proper loading and attachment of YouTube videos as files. - **🔄 Shared Chat Update**: Corrected issues where shared chats were not updating, improving collaboration consistency. - **🔍 DuckDuckGo Rate Limit Fix**: Addressed issues with DuckDuckGo search integration, enhancing search stability and performance when operating within rate limits. - **🧾 Citations Relevance Fix**: Adjusted the relevance percentage calculation for citations, so that Open WebUI properly reflect the accuracy of a retrieved document in RAG, ensuring users get clearer insights into sources. - **🔑 Jina Search API Key Requirement**: Added the option to input an API key for Jina Search, ensuring smooth functionality as keys are now mandatory.  ### Changed  - **🛠️ Functions Moved to Admin Panel**: As Functions operate as advanced plugins, they are now accessible from the Admin Panel instead of the workspace. - **🛠️ Manage Ollama Connections**: The "Models" section in Admin Settings has been relocated to Admin Settings > "Connections" > Ollama Connections. You can now manage Ollama instances via a dedicated "Manage Ollama" modal from "Connections", streamlining the setup and configuration of Ollama models. - **📊 Base Models in Admin Settings**: Admins can now find all base models, both connections or functions, in the "Models" Admin setting. Global model accessibility can be enabled or disabled here. Models are private by default, requiring explicit permission assignment for user access. - **📌 Sticky Model Selection for New Chats**: The model chosen from a previous chat now persists when creating a new chat. If you click "New Chat" again from the new chat page, it will revert to your default model. - **🎨 Design Refactoring**: Overall design refinements across the platform have been made, providing a more cohesive and polished user experience.  ### Removed  - **📂 Model List Reordering**: Temporarily removed and will be reintroduced in upcoming user group settings improvements. - **⚙️ Default Model Setting**: Removed the ability to set a default model for users, will be reintroduced with user group settings in the future.  👏 Massive thanks to our incredible contributors for their hard work and dedication to making this release possible: @silentoplayz, @Peter-De-Ath, @michaelpoluektov, @konmeo, @matthewhand, @dannyl1u, @aleixdorca, @clang88, @DmitriyAlergant-T1A, @krishanbhasin-px, @taylorwilsdon, @antpyykk-kone, @oyve, @yeounhak, @Menghuan1918, @OriginalSimon, @sakiphan  🚀 We'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our amazing sponsors for their generous support (Note: We've excluded private sponsors from this list.
