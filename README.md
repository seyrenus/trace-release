## 🛠️ v0.6.12-fix1  > [!WARNING] > Fixed the issue where the WebApp URL was incorrect and the problem where the model and tools icons weren’t showing up after starting from Docker Compose with default `.env`.  ---  ### 🎉 Upgrade to new docker compose deployment  #### Key Changes 1. **Persistent Custom Environment Variables**: Users can now declare environment variables in .env that remain persistent across deployments. This change ensures that custom configurations are not lost during upgrades or redeployments.  2. **Unified Vector Database Services**: All vector database services have been consolidated into a single Docker file. Users can switch between different vector databases by modifying the `VECTOR_STORE` environment variable in your local `.env`. This simplifies the management of various vdb services and allows for more dynamic deployments.  3. **Mandatory .env File**: Unlike the previous deployment method, the new method requires an [.env] file before running `docker compose up`. Users should start by copying the `.env.example` file to create their own `.env` file. This step is crucial for configuring the deployment to meet specific needs.  4. **Legacy Support**: The previous deployment files have been moved to a `docker-legacy` directory. These files will no longer be maintained, but they are available for use if needed.  #### Migrating For existing users who's customized `docker-compose.yaml`, `ssrf_proxy/squid.conf` or `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`, you may need to modify the corresponding environment variables in `.env` to reflect your existing changes.  We are actively seeking feedback from the community to refine and enhance the deployment process. As more users adopt this new method, we will continue to make improvements based on your experiences and suggestions.  #### How to Get Started To get started with the new deployment method: - Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. - Navigate to the new `docker` directory. - Copy the `docker/.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and customize it as needed. - Run `docker compose up` to start the services.  We encourage all users to transition to this new method to take advantage of the improved flexibility and configuration options. Your feedback during this beta phase is invaluable and will help us make the deployment process even better.  For detailed configuration options and environment variable settings, refer to the `.env.example` file and the Docker Compose configuration files in the [docker](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/tree/main/docker) directory.  ---  ## Upgrade Guide  ### Docker compose deployments  > [!WARNING] > The `docker-compose.yaml` has been refactored. If you've made any changes to the file, make sure to check out the "Upgrade to new docker compose deployment" section above for usage and migration tips.  1. Back up your customized docker-compose YAML file (optional)     bash    cd docker    cp docker-compose.yaml docker-compose.yaml.$(date +%s).bak      2. Get the latest code from the main branch     bash    git checkout main    git pull origin main      3. Stop the service，Command, please execute in the docker directory     bash    docker compose down      4. Back up data     bash    tar -cvf volumes-$(date +%s).tgz volumes      5. Upgrade services     bash    docker compose up -d       ### Source Code deployments  1. Stop API server, Worker and Web frontend Server.  2. Get the latest code from the main branch:     bash    git checkout main    git pull origin main      3. Update Python dependencies:     bash    cd api    poetry install      7. Then, let's run the migration script:     bash    poetry shell    flask db upgrade      8. Finally, run API server, Worker and Web frontend Server again.  ## What's Changed * add README for new docker/ directory by @guchenhe in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5724 * Chore/set entrypoint scripts permissions by @guchenhe in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5726 * Rename README to README.md by @guchenhe in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5727 * chore: support both $$ and $ latex format by @ZuzooVn in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5723 * fix: couldn't log in or resetup after a failed setup by @takatost in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5739 * fix: app config does not use empty string in the env by @takatost in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5741 * fix: env SMTP_PORT is empty caused err when launching by @takatost in https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5742   **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/langgenius/dify/compare/0.6.12...0.6.12-fix1

## [0.3.6] - 2024-06-27  ### Added  - **✨ "Functions" Feature**: You can now utilize "Functions" like filters (middleware) and pipe (model) functions directly within the WebUI. While largely compatible with Pipelines, these native functions can be executed easily within Open WebUI. Example use cases for filter functions include usage monitoring, real-time translation, moderation, and automemory. For pipe functions, the scope ranges from Cohere and Anthropic integration directly within Open WebUI, enabling "Valves" for per-user OpenAI API key usage, and much more. If you encounter issues, SAFE_MODE has been introduced. - **📁 Files API**: Compatible with OpenAI, this feature allows for custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in conjunction with the Filter Function. More examples will be shared on our community platform and official documentation website. - **🛠️ Tool Enhancements**: Tools now support citations and "Valves". Documentation will be available shortly. - **🔗 Iframe Support via Files API**: Enables rendering HTML directly into your chat interface using functions and tools.

```
**Hot fix because default folders even still weren't created correctly on Linux and macOS** Additionally this patch fixes that standard magic files weren't bundled properly anymore and a crash on exit  ImHex is **extremely** smooth now: https://twitter.com/WerWolv/status/1806807278416281861  ## Additions - Added basic process memory provider support to macOS     - Due to limitations on Apple's side, this only works with SIP disabled - View providers can now be renamed - Added options to load files into memory or read data from disk instead, independent of the file size - Find results can now be exported as CSVs, TSVs and JSONs. Thanks a lot to @SparkyTD - Added various per-byte highlights to the hex editor minimap     - The minimap can now display the highlighting of individual bytes - Added a digital signal pattern visualizer - The pattern data view now uses nicer colors and strings to convey information - The recent files section on the welcome screen can now be collapsed - You can now scroll the hex editor view faster by holding down CTRL or even faster when holding down SHIFT + CTRL - Added a `--reset-settings` CLI command to clear all settings in case something gets corrupted  ## Improvements - **Drastically improved rendering times** - Added a small moon icon to the welcome screen in nightly builds - Providers now close instantly - The hex editor view no longer scrolls when jumping to a selection that's already visible - Auto project backups are now enabled by default - Custom data inspector rows now display a nice error message in the UI when they encountered an error - Bookmark reordering now doesn't swap entries anymore and actually works as expected - ImHex now displays a little dot in the close button on macOS if there's unsaved changes - Auto backups no longer remove the dirty status of providers anymore - SIGINT signals are now being handled to not close ImHex immediately anymore but to show a popup - UI scaling factors are now limited between 0.1x and 4.0x to prevent issues     - Larger values are still possible by CTRL-clicking into the slider and entering a value manually - PageUp + PageDown no longer affects the hex editor selection - Row highlighting in the pattern data view is now less bright so the text has a better contrast  ## Bug Fixes - ImHex can now properly load files stored on network drives on Windows - Fixed crashes when searching for certain regex strings - Fixed an infinite loop when searching forward/backward with CTRL + F - Fixed loading of layout files - Fixed fonts being blurry in some cases - Bookmark regions can now be set to 1 byte - Fixes Alt and Ctrl being swapped in the text editor on macOS - Fixed disassembler always disassembling in little endian - ImHex no longer tries to store files in system paths now - Fixed an infinite loop when exporting data selections to a file. Thanks a lot to @FireNX70 - Fixed file name display issues with files that contain unicode characters - Fixed content store getting stuck sometimes when updating multiple items at once  ## Pattern Language  - `continue` and `break` now work as one would expect - Added `std::core::execute_function()` - Arrays can now be initialized using the following syntax:     - `u32 myArray[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };` - Added support for constants inside of custom types - Unsigned, signed and floating point patterns no longer display their hex value in their value by default - Fixed [[no_unique_address]] not working correctly with bitfields - Patterns are now highlighted in the hex editor view when hovering over them in the pattern data view - Patterns in the pattern data view table are now highlighted when they are fully selected in the hex editor view - Bitfields can now be properly edited in the pattern data view - The filter in the pattern data view now gets correctly applied again after re-evaluating a pattern  <br/>  <p align="center">If you like my work, please consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors, Patreon or PayPal.

### 2024-06-26T18:08:41Z [**Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot**](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot)

```
### Highlights  - **Retain post order**: Retain the order of posts in a feed when sending them. Previously, all new posts were sent simultaneously, losing their order within the feed. Note: Posts from different feeds are still sent simultaneously, so it is expected to see them interlaced. - **Rewritten monitor**: The feed monitor has been rewritten for flexibility and robustness. It is now more memory-efficient and can smooth out spikes in CPU usage.  ### Enhancements  - **Print Telegram user info of bot**: Print the bot's Telegram user info when the bot is started. This is to help bot managers to find the bot's username and user ID when deploying the bot. - **Minor refactor**: Some internal functions have been refactored to improve performance and maintainability.  ### Bug fixes  - **Exit with 0 when disconnected**: If the bot was logged out due to a network error or Telegram DC degradation, it would exit with exit-code 0. This led to confusion when the bot was running in a container or as a service. Now the bot will exit with exit-code 100 when disconnected. - **Unable to handle completely empty posts**: Fix `AttributeError` caused by completely empty posts. They are ignored now. - **Minor bug fixes**  <hr>  ## v2.8.0: 保留文章顺序，重写的监视器和更多  ### 亮点  - **保留文章顺序**: 在发送文章时保留文章在 feed 中的顺序。先前，所有新文章都被同时发送，失去了它们在 feed 中的顺序。注意：来自不同 feed 的文章仍然同时发送，因此预计会看到它们交错。 - **重写的监视器**: Feed 监视器已被重写，以提高灵活性和稳健性。它现在更节省内存，并且可以平滑 CPU 使用率的波动。  ### 增强  - **打印 bot 的 Telegram 用户信息**: 在 bot 启动时打印 bot 的 Telegram 用户信息。这是为了帮助 bot 管理员在部署 bot 时找到 bot 的用户名和用户 ID。 - **次要的重构**: 重构了一些内部函数以提高性能和可维护性。  ### Bug 修复  - **断开连接后以 0 退出**: 过去，如果 bot 由于网络错误或 Telegram DC 降级而被登出，它将以退出码 0 退出。当 bot 在容器中或作为服务运行时，这会导致混乱。现在，当断开连接时，机器人将以退出码 100 退出。 - **无法处理完全空白的文章**: 修复由完全空白的文章引起的 `AttributeError`。它们现在会被忽略。 - **次要的 bug 修复**
