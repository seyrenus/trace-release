此版本新增了一些实验中功能，这些功能后续可能会进行大规模变动。  ## 新增调度器与 Javascript 脚本  BetterGI 通过 [ClearScript](https://github.com/microsoft/ClearScript) 内置 V8 引擎，支持直接运行 Javascript 编写的脚本，并开放各类 BetterGI 的 API。由于初版 API 还未完全暴露完毕，暂不提供编写文档。  **自动晶蝶** 是内置的第一个脚本，调用了内部的大地图识别并传送的功能，然后执行键鼠脚本。  由于键鼠脚本分享时，不同电脑存在很多影响变量，**测试发现存在大量无法正确重放的情况**。  所以，**自动晶蝶脚本并不是所有人都能够正常运行！**  ## 优化与改动  - 键鼠脚本的录制与回放从相对时间修改为绝对时间，大幅提高精度，减少卡顿，**但是不兼容 0.33 版本前的键鼠脚本** @lwh9346  - 启动时检查是否有关键文件缺失，缺失时提示 #468 @qhy040404  - 修复更新提示弹窗位置未适配高分屏DPI缩放 #446 @emako  - code clean up  @qhy040404 @Lightczx  - 修复了一些配置不生效的问题 - 优化内部地图匹配的代码

```
### Features  * Added a new plugin `tls2raw`: Enables TLS termination and forwarding of decrypted raw traffic to local service. * Added a default timeout of 30 seconds for the frpc subcommands to prevent commands from being stuck for a long time due to network issues.  ### Fixes  * Fixed the issue that when `loginFailExit = false`, the frpc stop command cannot be stopped correctly if the server is not successfully connected after startup.
