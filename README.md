## RAG Changes   ### Store RAG in YAML format instead of bin format  We used to store RAG in bin format at `<aichat-config-dir>/rags/<name>.bin`. However, the `bin` format has various drawbacks, so we are now using the `yaml` format to store RAG.   All RAGs in bin format will be ignored. Please recreate them in YAML format.  ### Support for RAG-scoped `top_k` and `reranker_model` options  Now, users can set the `top_k` and `reranker_model` parameters individually for each RAG.   .set rag_top_k 5 .set rag_reranker_model cohere:rerank-english-v3.0   ## New REPL Commands   .delete                  Delete roles/sessions/RAGs/agents .save agent-config       Save the current agent config to file .sources rag             View the RAG sources in the last query   ## New Features  - add config `serve_addr` & env $SERVE_ADDR for specifying serve addr ([#839](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/839)) - better html to markdown converter ([#840](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/840)) - add role %create-prompt% ([#843](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/843)) - tolerate failure to load some rag files ([#846](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/846)) - support RAG-scoped rag_top_k and rag_reranker_model ([#847](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/847)) - save rag in YAML instead of bin ([#848](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/848)) - chat-completions api supports tools ([#850](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/850)) - support rerank api ([#851](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/851)) - abandon config `rag_min_score_rerank` ([#852](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/852)) - add `.delete` repl command ([#862](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/862)) - no delete the existing role/session when saving with a new name ([#863](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/863)) - specify shell via $AICHAT_SHELL ([#866](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/866)) - role/session/agent should not inherit the global `use_tools` ([#868](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/868)) - add `.save agent-config` repl command ([#870](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/870)) - add `.sources rag` repl command ([#871](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/871))  ## Bug Fixes  - render stream failed due to read cursor position timeout ([#835](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/pull/835))
