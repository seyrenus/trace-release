## 🚀 What’s New in v0.13.0? 🚀  Hey there, update seekers! Welcome to version 0.13.0. We’ve packed a lot of goodies in this release, from fixes and feature upgrades to some nice behind-the-scenes refactoring. Here's the scoop:  ### ✨ New Features  - **Variable Assigner Node Update**     The Variable Assigner node now supports several powerful features to streamline workflows:     **• Operations on multiple conversation variables** in a single node.     **• *Extend* operator** to link two arrays seamlessly.     **• *Set* operator** to assign constants to variables directly.      <img width="1832" alt="variable assigner" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c9572c-4f22-42f8-9a2e-eed435b0b8c8">    📄 [Read the full documentation](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/workflow/node/variable-assigner)  - **Github DSL URL Support**     You can now use `github.com` links directly for DSLs instead of relying on `raw.githubusercontent.com`. This makes integration smoother and more intuitive. Thanks to @yihong0618 in #11125.  - **VTT File Support**     Document Extractor can now handle VTT files for all your subtitle extraction needs. Big thanks to @fujita-h in #11148.  - **Conversational Opener Upgrade**     More opening questions for your conversations, increasing engagement points. Thanks to @fujita-h in #11233.  ### 🛠️ Improvements and Fixes  - **LLM Invoke Errors**     Reduced noise from unnecessary exceptions—LLM node invoke errors will no longer recorded in the logs. Thanks to @laipz8200 in #11141.  - **Parameter Type Fix**     Resolved an issue with the parameter extractor function that expected a string and wasn't given one. Kudos to @charli117 in #11142.  - **ToolInvokeMessage Validation Fix**     Fixed validation errors for ToolInvokeMessages when the blob_message meta is missing. Thanks to @catusax in #11212.  - **Claude Handling**     Claude can now handle empty strings gracefully. Thanks to @yihong0618 in #11238.  - **Redis Port Double Split Fix**     Adjusted the Redis port handling logic to address double-split issues. Thanks to @yihong0618 in #11270.  - **Modular App Features**     Reorganized app features into modular components for improved scalability and development ease. Shoutout to @bowenliang123 in #9129.  That’s the short version, but as always, there’s plenty more in the logs for those who like a deep dive. Update your systems and take these features for a spin. Keep building, keep exploring, and stay tuned for more!  ---  ## Upgrade Guide  ### Docker compose deployments  > [!WARNING] > > The files in the docker-legacy directory will soon stop being maintained and will be removed from the repository.

There have been many important contributions in the last few months. Some notable changes are: adding hot-reload for the configuration, exporting rules via dunstctl, adding color gradients, removing default hard-coded icons. For detailed information consult the changelog.  Important notice for all users:  The behaviour of the setting `height` has been changed in a breaking way. Before you could specify a single value that would be used as the max height of a notification. In this release the dynamic height was implemented to make this settings behave more similarly to `width`. Now the values accepted are either a single number (for a *fixed height*) or a tuple of numbers (for a min/max range).  The way of specifying a maximum height before was:     height = 300  The equivalent way now is:     height = (0, 300)  Furthermore the preferred syntax for the `offset` settings has been changed from NxN to (N,N). The old syntax is supported nevertheless.  If you are a maintainer it would be helpful to include the message above when an user updates from an older version of dunst.  Take a look at the changelog for all the bug fixes and improvements.  ### Added - Export rules via dbus with `dunstctl rules [--json]` (#1212) - Added checks and messages for missing DBUS\_SESSION\_BUS\_ADDRESS (#1389) - Add `-e/--exit` flag to `dunstctl is-paused` to exit with 1 when paused (#1378) - Add color gradients for the progress bar (by providing a list of colors instead of one) (#1370) - Use TESTDIR env var as the base for the test program (#1376) - Add `dunstctl reload` to hot reload the configuration (#1350) - Add an optional id to `dunstctl close` (#1351) - Print compile-time options in `dunst --version` (#1336)  ### Changed - BREAKING: Implement dynamic height (changes the the `height` setting, see manual) (#1342) - Change the preferred syntax of `offset` from `NxN` to `(N,N)` (#1330) - Install the systemd service file in the session.slice (#1397) - Open url with `dunstctl action` if no action is present (#1345,#1395) - Remove default icons (now no icons are hard-coded) (#1365,#1358) - Various updates to documentation and test suite  ### Fixed - Order of context menu was reversed (#1394,#1375) - Resolve ~ and $HOME in `icon_path` (#1383,#1371) - Fix broken link to freedesktop's notification specs in man page (#1381) - Remove the message about shortcuts deprecation (#1353) - Fix vertical padding behaviour (#1342) - Fix bash completion (#1347) - Fix file suffix for fish completions during installation (#1339)  ## New Contributors * @d2718nis made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1353 * @Phantomwise made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1381 * @cwrau made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1378 * @Atemu made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1397  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/compare/v1.11.0...v1.12.0

# What’s new in Novu 2.1.0?  **TL;DR:** Preferences remodelling for 70% improvement in performance of Preference retrieval with an **important** database migration, 46% reduction in Docker image sizes, and more.  ## 2.1.0 Release Updates  We're excited to share updated focussed on improving database and operational performance in our latest release. Join us as we reveal the improvements our team have been working on!  ## Preference remodelling and optimization  - All Workflow & Subscriber preferences are now stored in a central Preferences collection to streamline preference retrieval for the `<Inbox />` + Subscriber Preference API for a more performance subscriber preference management experience, and performance improvements of Worker engine during notification delivery  - **IMPORTANT**: A mandatory database migration is required with this release to prepare for the removal of the `SubscriberPreference` collection and the `NotificationTemplateRepository`.`{preferenceSettings,critical}` property in a subsequent release. This data is migrated to a centralized Preference collection. Please visit the [Data Migration documentation](https://docs.novu.co/additional-resources/data-migrations) for more information on running the migration script. The following migration of data takes place:    - Workflow preference (`NotificationTemplate`.`preferenceSettings`)      -   -> `Preference` record with `type: 'WORKFLOW_RESOURCE'` (for Code-First workflow support)      -   -> `Preference` record with `type: 'USER_WORKFLOW'` (for Dashboard/API user preference support)    - Subscriber Global preference (`SubscriberPreference` with `level: 'GLOBAL'`)      -   -> `Preference` record with `type: 'SUBSCRIBER_GLOBAL'`    - Subscriber Workflow preference (`SubscriberPreference` with `level: 'TEMPLATE'`)      -   -> `Preference` record with `type: 'SUBSCRIBER_WORKFLOW'`    ## Docker Image optimization for all applications  - 46% reduction in Docker image sizes  - Simplified COPY and RUN commands  - Overall optimization of image structure  - Replace external PM2 dependency for graceful shutdowns with native NestJS shutdown module   ## What's Changed * perf(framework): Replace all computed property keys with static
