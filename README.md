# What’s new in Novu 0.22?  **TL;DR:** All you need to know about the latest Novu 0.22.0 release. Multi-tenancy Variants, API Idempotency, API Rate Limiting, Filter conditional variables and more!  ## 0.22 Release Updates  We're excited to highlight the newest features introduced in our latest release. Join us as we explore what awaits you!  ![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/24ead07c-d967-4d32-b463-9e35acf059b8)  ## Multi-tenancy Variants  Variants is an integral component of our multi-tenancy feature and aims to empower users to create multiple variants for a given workflow step, such as the Email step. These step variations are linked to specific conditions.  Within the multi-tenancy context, these conditions may pertain to tenants; for instance, if the tenant is named "Nike", a specific email variant will be chosen.  However, these conditions extend beyond tenants, allowing users to base their criteria on the trigger payload, subscriber data, or webhook data.  During the notification sending phase, the system’s logic will determine the appropriate variant based on the contextual information that was passed with the trigger event and the conditions applied to the variants. Only a single variant will be selected and sent to the user at the end.  **Note:** We have renamed the Filters functionality to Conditions.  ![variants](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/19fdaf4c-26ff-482f-b98a-44f51860c048)  ![variants](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/26bf56d1-1881-4bde-8a09-414622622cbd)  *Adding a variant to email step*  In this gif above, we added a variant to our email step, thus making us have the **root variant** (with no condition) that will be sent if there's no tenant identifier specified, and a **variant** that will be sent if the tenant identifier is Nike.  ## Idempotency  To enhance the resilience and dependability of our API system, especially during disruptive scenarios like network interruptions, we have introduced the Idempotency headers to POST and PATCH HTTP methods within the API.  We have now granted users the ability to include Idempotency headers in their requests. A given operation will not be executed more than once, even if users resubmit the request following a perceived failure.  This guarantees that we process changes in a fail-safe manner, and the system caches the response for a day for future reference. This approach ensures that only valid and unique changes are processed, contributing to the overall robustness and reliability of our API system.  **Note:** Currently, the Idempotency headers are not enabled on the Novu cloud but functionality is available for self-hosting. We are currently integrating it into all of our SDKs as well.  Huge shoutout to @mahendraHegde for bringing in the Idempotency feature and to @michaldziuba03 for implementing the exponential retry mechanism in Node SDK! Your contribution rocks, much appreciated! 🙌  **PRs:**  - feat: add idempotency interceptor by @mahendraHegde in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4531 - fix(api): Use correct idempotency documentation link by @rifont in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4710 - feat(node): add exponential retry mechanism with idempotency headers by @michaldziuba03 in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4462  ## API Rate Limiting  Rate limiting is an essential functionality for establishing a robust and resilient system. It safeguards system resources from being misused by malicious actors or being monopolized by one client.  It plays a vital role in sustaining consistent system performance by regulating traffic and preventing sudden increases that could degrade service quality.  **Note:** It's not currently enabled on Novu Cloud yet. We'll inform all users whenever we want to enable this option for all cloud users. If you're self-hosting, you can enable API rate limiting immediately with the `IS_API_RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED` flag in the environment variable.  **PRs:**  - feat(application-generic, shared): Add Rate Limiting feature flag in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4667 - feat(dal, shared, api): Add rate limit DAL attributes by @rifont in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4758 - feat(api, shared): Add use cases to resolve an environment's api rate limit in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4774 - chore(api, shared, app-generic): Convert API rate limit FF to be LaunchDarkly compatible in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4857 - feat(api): Add evaluate api rate limit use case in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4844 - feat(api): Add API rate limiting NestJS guard in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4910 - feat(api): Apply rate limit decorators to api controllers and methods in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4915 - feat(api): Add variable-cost token bucket rate limiting algorithm in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4911  ## Variable Support in the Step Conditions aka Filters  The condition `Value` field now supports the use of variables as its value, enhancing the dynamic nature of this functionality.  ![variables_in_step_conditions](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/12728884-6619-47fe-add2-132c148d4f42)  **PRs:**  - feat: add support for variables in filter values https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4724  ## Workflow Settings Override for tenants  The workflow settings override functionality allows to update the `active` and `channel` preferences fields on the workflow per tenant.  A good use case for this is the ability to have the following setting preferences enabled for all users, but you want them disabled for specific tenants. For example, you have about 3 tenants: Nike, Cloudinary and Eden. You can create a new settings override by passing the `tenantId` and `workflowId`, and your preferences.  We have implemented the set of the API endpoints that allow the following:  - Creating, updating and deleting overrides, - List all overrides, or for one template.  ![override1](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/e8c5a87a-b634-4678-98e6-4d0e18d1ce1a)  ![override2](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/42b58de4-d203-4c0d-b35f-f3f24654d072)  *Create new workflow settings overrides*  ![override3](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/13fcce5b-e785-4d3a-a816-e9dcd412c87d)   *Update workflow settings overrides*  **PRs:**  - Stacked PR's of - Workflow override in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4773  **Note:** We are currently working on ensuring our SDKs have support for this functionality.  ## Event Cancellation from Digest  We have added a new API endpoint that allows the cancellation of any event from the digest.  ![digest](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/660d8bd8-1e16-47b3-9a14-ae3f64b3c357)  **Note:** We are currently updating all of our SDKs to support this new functionality.  **PRs:**  - Feature: Ability to cancel any arbitrary events from digest in https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/4888  ## Resiliency and Performance Improvements  We have done some performance plumbing to improve the speed & resilience of the overall system. Our goal is to keep working on performance, reliability and resilience in every release.  ## Custom SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages using custom SMS providers using REST API. Do this by setting up the Generic SMS provider:  ![custom_sms](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/968556aa-cdd7-444a-81cc-451553780b01)  ![custom_sms2](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/064a74bc-515c-4e26-8126-25bfaec61150)  ## MessageBird SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages via the MessageBird SMS provider integration:  ![messagebird](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/efb89d0e-175d-4700-b70a-dc6b2f7c2697)  ## BulkSMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages via the BulkSMS SMS provider integration:  ![bulksms](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/bf474264-f3fa-450c-a4ef-fb6635110a3a)  ## SimpleTexting SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages via the SimpleTexting SMS provider integration:  ![simpletexting](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/0759e22a-3bd2-4789-9e07-17f62f9b7510)  ## Azure SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages via the Azure SMS provider integration:  ![azure_sms](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/96f68238-8401-4094-90bb-1d4126fbb6b9)  ## Braze Email Provider Integration  You can now send emails via the Braze Email provider integration:  ![braze](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/121c4eff-26c5-4c81-b0a5-5d2e762eb680)  ## Pusher Beams Provider Integration  You can now send messages via the Pusher Beams provider integration:  ![pusher_beams](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/b070a934-f8bd-4c43-b15a-bf0292b5b991)  ## Grafana On Call Webhook Chat Provider Integration  You can now send messages via the Grafana On Call webhook chat provider integration:  ![grafana](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/096280c9-952a-41c3-90e5-8ef1faa6c97e)  ## Notable changes  -

### ⬆️ Improvements - #4216 Due to a security patch in 1.23.9, some Uptime Kuma setups behind a reverse proxy required re-configuration.  It is no longer necessary now.    - If you added `UPTIME_KUMA_WS_ORIGIN_CHECK=bypass` in the previous version, you should remove it to enhance protection, unless you are using some 3rd-party plugins/apps.  ### ⬆️ Security Fixes - #4213 https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3 was not fully patched due to a careless mistake (Thanks @chakflying)

# Major mouse improvements, better input parsing, and lots more!  We hope you’re ready for winter. Unless you’re in the southern hemisphere (like @caarlos0) in which case, we hope you’re ready for summer. In either case, we hope you have a happy new year if the Julian calendar is something you’re into.  There are a bunch of good features in this release and a ton of input-related improvements. Read on for more!  ## Extended Mouse Mode  Bubble Tea now supports Extended Mouse Mode (aka SGR mode) which makes now mouse support in Bubble Tea _way_, _way_ better.  Prior to this release Bubble Tea used the X10 mouse protocol. X10 was last released in 1986: a time when screen resolutions were smaller, memory limits were low, and a terminal sizes were tiny. For terminals and mice this meant that the mouse tracking stopped after the 127th horizontal cell. Well, thanks to the elite abilities of @aymanbagabas Bubble Tea can now track mouse movements across the entire terminal window, no matter how enormous.  And that's not all: Bubble Tea now has higher fidelity access to mouse operations such as <kbd>shift</kbd>, <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, and <kbd>alt</kbd> modifiers, mouse button release events, and a big range of mouse button and mouse wheel events.  For details see the docs for the new and improved [`MouseEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea@v0.25.0#MouseEvent).  ## Setting the Window Title  @aymanbagabas also wanted to be able to set the terminal window title with Bubble Tea, so he added the [`SetWindowTitle`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea@v0.25.0#SetWindowTitle) `Cmd`. Now setting the window title is as simple as:  go func (m Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model. tea.Cmd) {     return m, tea.SetWindowTitle("oh my") }   ## FPS Control  Have you ever thought “Bubble Tea is too fast and I just can’t handle it?” Or perhaps 60fps is too slow and you want to go full 120fps. Now, thanks to @tomfeigin’s [`WithFPS`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea@v0.25.0#WithFPS) `ProgramOption` you can:  go // Let’s go with the classic soap opera frame rate p := tea.NewProgram(model, tea.WithMaxFPS(45))   ## Better Input, Better Living  @knz is just incredible. He took a look at Bubble Tea’s input parser and whipped it into shape with what felt like a flick of the wrist. Keyboard input is now more efficient than ever and very large amounts of input can be parsed with the greatest of ease. It's hard to overstate how impactful his contributions are—and there are more in the pipe.  # Changelog  ## New!  * Extended Coordinates mouse reporting and additional button support by @aymanbagabas in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/594 * Option to set max FPS by @tomfeigin in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/578 * `SetWindowTitle` command by @aymanbagabas in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/611  ## Fixed  * Invert the key parsing control loop by @knz in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/569 * Simplify the key input analysis code by @knz in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/568 * Support very long buffered input in key parsing by @knz in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/570 * Make `ReleaseTerminal`/`RestoreTerminal` thread safe by @caarlos0 in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/791  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/compare/v0.24.2...v0.25.0  ## New Contributors  * @tomfeigin made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/578 * @bloznelis made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/763 * @grafviktor made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/770 * @naglis made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/787 * @grrlopes made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/804 * @Juneezee made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/812 * @ddworken made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/828 * @wI2L made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/829 * @guyfedwards made their first contribution in https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/pull/865  ---  <a href="https://charm.sh/"><img alt="The Charm logo" src="https://stuff.charm.sh/charm-badge.jpg" width="400"></a>  Thoughts?

```
### Features  * The new command line parameter `--strict_config` has been added to enable strict configuration validation mode. It will throw an error for unknown fields instead of ignoring them. In future versions, we will set the default value of this parameter to true to avoid misconfigurations. * Support `SSH reverse tunneling`. With this feature, you can expose your local service without running frpc, only using SSH. The SSH reverse tunnel agent has many functional limitations compared to the frpc agent. The currently supported proxy types are tcp, http, https, tcpmux, and stcp. * The frpc tcpmux command line parameters have been updated to support configuring `http_user` and `http_pwd`. * The frpc stcp/sudp/xtcp command line parameters have been updated to support configuring `allow_users`.  ### Fixes  * frpc: Return code 1 when the first login attempt fails and exits. * When auth.method is `oidc` and auth.additionalScopes contains `HeartBeats`, if obtaining AccessToken fails, the application will be unresponsive.
