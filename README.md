**This is a hotfix release for the [2025.04.13](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/tag/2025.04.13) recent release.** Since we made a breaking change of renaming commands with `_` to `-`, we added the previous command name aliases which inform about it (#2891, #2878).  We also bumped the LLDB version to 20 (#2880). This is also the last release with Capstone v5.  In short this and previous (2025.04.13) release adds displaying of breakpoints in disasm view (shown as "b+" by default), new command (`libcinfo`), improved LLDB support (CTRL+C cancellation and programmatic controls of debugger) as well as [better docs](https://pwndbg.re/pwndbg/dev/) and commands & UI fixes and improvements. We now also publish portable builds for: * GDB and LLDB `*_loongarch64-portable.tar.xz` build for LoongArch64 Linux * Native GDB build for Apple Silicon (remote ELF debugging only)  **Below, we list a more detailed changelog from 2025.04.13. For installation, see the ["Which version to download?" section](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/tag/2025.04.18#:~:text=Don%27t%20know%20which%20version%20to%20download%3F).**  **Also, want to support us?

```
### Notes  *   **Feature Gates Introduced:** This version introduces a new experimental mechanism called Feature Gates. This allows users to enable or disable specific experimental features before they become generally available. Feature gates can be configured in the `featureGates` map within the configuration file. *   **VirtualNet Feature Gate:** The first available feature gate is `VirtualNet`, which enables the experimental Virtual Network functionality (currently in Alpha stage).  ### Features  *   **Virtual Network (VirtualNet):** Introduce experimental virtual network capabilities (Alpha). This allows creating a TUN device managed by frp, enabling Layer 3 connectivity between different clients within the frp network. Requires root/admin privileges and is currently supported on Linux and macOS. Configuration is done via the `virtualNet` section and the `virtual_net` plugin. Enable with feature gate `VirtualNet`. **Note: As an Alpha feature, configuration details may change in future releases.**

### 2025-04-20T13:35:08Z [**fish-shell/fish-shell**](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

```
This release of fish fixes a number of issues identified in fish 4.0.1:  - Completions are quoted, rather than backslash-escaped, only if the completion is unambiguous. Continuing to edit the token is therefore easier ([#11271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11271)). This changes the behavior introduced in 4.0.0 where all completions were quoted. - The warning when the terminfo database can‚Äôt be found has been downgraded to a log message. fish will act as if the terminal behaves like xterm-256color, which is correct for the vast majority of cases ([#11277](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11277), [#11290](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11290)). - Key combinations using the super (Windows/command) key can now (actually) be bound using the `super-` prefix ([#11217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11217)). This was listed in the release notes for 4.0.1 but did not work correctly. - [function](cmds/function.md) is stricter about argument parsing, rather than allowing additional parameters to be silently ignored ([#11295](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11295)). - Using parentheses in the [test](cmds/test.md) builtin works correctly, following a regression in 4.0.0 where they were not recognized ([#11387](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11387)). - `delete` in Vi mode when Num Lock is active will work correctly ([#11303](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11303)). - Abbreviations cannot alter the command-line contents, preventing a crash ([#11324](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11324)). - Improvements to various completions, including new completions for `wl-randr` ([#11301](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11301)), performance improvements for `cargo` completions by avoiding network requests ([#11347](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11347)), and other improvements for  `btrfs` ([#11320](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11320)), `cryptsetup` ([#11315](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11315)), `git` ([#11319](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11319), [#11322](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11322), [#11323](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11323)), `jj` ([#11046](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11046)), and `systemd-analyze` ([#11314](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11314)). - The Mercurial (`hg`) prompt can handle working directories that contain an embedded newline, rather than producing errors ([#11348](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11348)). - A number of crashes have been fixed. Triggers include prompts containing backspace characters ([#11280](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11280)), history pager search ([#11355](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11355)), invalid UTF-8 in [read](cmds/read.md) ([#11383](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11383)), and the `kill-selection` binding ([#11367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11367)). - A race condition in the test suite has been fixed ([#11254](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11254)), and a test for fish versioning relaxed to support downstream distributors‚Äô modifications ([#11173](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11173)). - Small improvements to the documentation ([#11264](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11264), [#11329](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11329), [#11361](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11361)).  ----  *Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named "fish-4.0.2.tar.xz".
