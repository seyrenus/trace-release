# Suspending, environment hacking, and more  Hi! This release has three nice little features and some bug fixes. Let's take a look:  ## Suspending and resuming  At last, now you can programmatically suspend and resume programs with the [`tea.Suspend`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#Suspend) command and handle resumes with the [`tea.ResumeMsg`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#ResumeMsg) message:  go func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) { 	switch msg := msg.(type) {  	// Suspend with ctrl+z! 	case tea.KeyMsg: 		switch msg.String() { 		case "ctrl+z": 			m.suspended = true 			return m, tea.Suspend 		}  	// Handle resumes 	case tea.ResumeMsg: 		m.suspended = false 		return m, nil 	}  	// ... }   [Example](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/blob/d6a19f0eb5a983610bd65a1647f5955abe3ee69e/examples/suspend/main.go)  There's also a [`tea.SuspendMsg`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#SuspendMsg) that flows through `Update` on suspension.  Special thanks to @knz for prototyping the original implementation of this.  ## Setting the environment  When Bubble Tea is behind [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish) you may have needed to pass environment variables from the remote session to the `Program`. Now you can with the all new [tea.WithEnvironment](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#WithEnvironment):  go var sess ssh.Session // ssh.Session is a type from the github.com/charmbracelet/ssh package pty, _, _ := sess.Pty() environ := append(sess.Environ(), "TERM="+pty.Term) p := tea.NewProgram(model, tea.WithEnvironment(environ)   ## Requesting the window dimensions  All the Bubble Tea pros know that you get a `tea.WindowSizeMsg` when the `Program` starts and when the window resizes. Now you can just query it on demand too with the [`tea.WindowSize`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#WindowSize) command.  ## Changelog  ### New!  * 7d708384a105005dfbcec2290bfe4ea1d0e8d9f0: feat: add a cmd to request window size (#988) (@aymanbagabas) * ea13ffb9a18d0925491eeb580c66b4c6b2f4284f: feat: allow to suspend bubbletea programs (#1054) (@caarlos0) * cae9acdf7b37b5723078bae2eaa99ca14c6bcd05: feat: set the program environment variables (#1063) (@aymanbagabas)   ### Fixed  * 7c1bfc0e55e65bc6d52ec1e126d97ee45ddbeb08: query window-size in a goroutine (#1059) (@aymanbagabas) * 4497aa9eef1ce78044d016782e9301dcb1b7c288: reset cursor position on renderer exit (#1058) (@aymanbagabas) * d6a19f0eb5a983610bd65a1647f5955abe3ee69e: wrap `ErrProgramKilled` error (@aymanbagabas) * 4a9620e7134978771059ff7b481b6c9a8c611ac3: fix bugs in package-manager example (@AkshayKalose)  ---  <a href="https://charm.sh/"><img alt="The Charm logo" src="https://stuff.charm.sh/charm-badge.jpg" width="400"></a>  Thoughts?
