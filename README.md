### 2025-04-08T12:37:30Z [**sxyazi/yazi**](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)

```
## Breaking Changes  - Supported wraparound navigation and enabled it by default. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485 - Replaced `tasks_show` and `close_input` with `tasks:show` and `input:close`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2530 - `frag`, `name`, `stem`, `ext`, and `parent` on [`Url`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#shared.url), `name` on [`tab::Tab`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#app-data.tab-tab), and `is_hovered` on [`fs::File`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/plugins/types#app-data.fs-file) are now properties. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2572 - Swapped the default key bindings for `z` (zoxide) and `Z` (fzf). https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2546 - Used the new `@sync peek` annotation instead of the previewer's `sync = true`. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2487  ## Deprecated  - `ui.Padding` and `ui.Rect:padding()` are deprecated. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2574  ## Packaging  - SVG preview backend switched from ImageMagick to [`resvg`](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) and implemented as a new `svg` previewer. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533, https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2581  ## Custom Search Engine Lua API  With https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2452, you can create custom search engines via the Lua API, meaning that plugins can serve as the source for search view file lists.  A new plugin [vcs-files.yazi](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/vcs-files.yazi) is available to display the list of files changed in Git within Yazi:  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6f7d55-002b-4933-b8e8-41f335b96a2b  ## Platform-Specific Key Binding  https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2526 adds a new *optional* `for` field to key bindings to specify the platform the key binding applies to.  For example:  sh { on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd ~/dev',  desc = 'Go dev',    for = 'unix' }, { on = [ 'g', 'd' ], run = 'cd C:\dev', desc = 'Go C:\dev', for = 'windows' },   ## Performance Improvements  This version brings several performance enhancements:  - Configuration parser has been rewritten to double the startup speed. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2508 - AVIF, HEIF, and JPEG XL previews have seen significant performance improvements. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533, thanks @ze0987 - Compiled and cached the Lua bytecode to enhance the overall performance of the plugin system. https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2490  ## Enhance `fzf` Integration  Now, you can select multiple files in `fzf`, and the selected files will also be selected in Yazi.  Also, you can now view, navigate, and deselect the file selection list from Yazi within `fzf`.  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b175a3-fa73-4128-8239-f90e45f13ab3  See https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/issues/2546 for more details.  ## Use Yazi File Manager Directly in Helix, Without Zellij or tmux  https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2461 adapted Yazi to support Helix's `:insert-output`, which means you can now run Yazi directly within Helix – it even supports image and video previews!  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dbf7aca-fc4e-4f9e-b554-70cadedf0484  ## New `prev` and `next` Arguments to `arrow` for Wraparound Navigation  Circular navigation is one of the long-requested features, and is now supported via the new `arrow prev` and `arrow next` commands in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485.  ## New `follow` Command to Follow Files Pointed to by Symlinks  https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2543 adds support for following files pointed to by symlinks.  A new key binding, `g` => `f` (follow hovered symlink), has been added to use this feature.  ## Allow Initializing Input When Opening It with Commands Like `rename`, `create`, `find`, `filter`, etc.  With https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2578, you can now customize the input box opened by commands such as `create`, `rename`, `cd`, `filter`, `find`, `search`, and `shell`. For example:  sh { on = "r", run = [ "rename", "input:escape" ] }   This will open the rename input box and exit insert mode, meaning that the default state will be normal mode.  ## What's Changed * feat: new `<C-A>` and `<C-E>` keybindings to select entire line for the input component by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2439 * fix: reserve a hack for Zellij to force an image adapter by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2441 * feat: new `rt.term` exports terminal emulator information by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2442 * fix: always show the size in the status bar even in empty directories by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2449 * feat: allow `tab_swap` to cycle tabs by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2456 * feat: support using Yazi in Helix directly without Zellij or tmux by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2461 * refactor: prefer `WriteConsoleW` for Windows console output by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2464 * ci: add label only if not removed manually by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2470 * fix: force ANSI for keyboard progressive enhancement on Windows by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2474 * feat: new `fs.expand_url` API by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2476 * feat!: file navigation wraparound with new `arrow prev` and `arrow next` commands by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2485 * feat!: new `@sync peek` annotation for sync previewers by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2487 * perf: lazy compile and cache lua plugins as binary bytecode by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2490 * feat: new `base` field for the `Url` userdata by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2492 * feat: allow repositioning the cursor in the `rename` DDS event by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2521 * feat: new `symlink_target` to style the target of symbolic links by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2522 * feat: platform-specific key binding by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2526 * feat: show error message when directory fails to load by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2527 * feat: allow bulk renaming to include trailing content in addition to the required new names by @MikuGeek in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2494 * refactor!: remove unnecessary `tasks_show` and `close_input` commands by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2530 * perf!: faster image preview with optimized `magick` arguments by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533 * feat!: support `arrow prev` and `arrow next` for more components by @XOR-op in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2540 * feat: clear terminal before displaying EXIF data by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2541 * feat: new `follow` command to follow files pointed to by symlinks by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2543 * fix: always check whether the cursor exceeds the upper bound to guard against unexpected values by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2551 * feat!: enhance `fzf` integration by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2553 * feat: support Warp terminal image preview by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2571 * feat: allow initializing input when opening it with commands like `rename`, `create`, `find`, `filter`, etc. by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2578 * fix: ignore XQuartz `$DISPLAY` variable by @sxyazi in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2586 * fix: don't fail on videos with embedded images by @ze0987 in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2590  ## New Contributors * @MikuGeek made their first contribution in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2494 * @ze0987 made their first contribution in https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/pull/2533  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/compare/v25.3.2...v25.4.8

## 更新  - 修复: 软件根目录创建`任务计划程序`脚本未指定工作目录  > 软件根目录脚本 `install_startup.bat` 和 `uninstall_startup.bat` 用来创建和删除任务计划程序，主要是为了以管理员权限启动软件而不经过`UAC弹窗`确认（也可以创建普通权限启动） > **该脚本与软件内设置`开机自启动`不兼容，脚本创建任务计划程序后建议关闭软件内`开机启动项`配置**  **完整更新日志:** [1.5.1.407...1.5.2.408](https://github.com/ZGGSONG/STranslate/compare/1.5.1.407...1.5.2.408)  ## 合作推广  🛠️ **官方API合作伙伴**    [DeerAPI](https://api.deerapi.com/register?aff=j5dj) - AI聚合平台，一键调用500+模型，7折特惠，最新GPT4o、Grok 3、Gemini 2.5pro全支持！  [点击注册](https://api.deerapi.com/register?aff=j5dj)享免费试用额度，也能支持软件长久发展   ## 离线数据  [123 网盘](https://www.123pan.com/s/AxlRjv-OuVmA.html)  > 离线数据包含: [简明英汉词典数据包](https://github.com/skywind3000/ECDICT/releases/download/1.0.28/ecdict-sqlite-28.zip)  [PaddleOCR数据包(v4.3)](https://github.com/ZGGSONG/STranslate/releases/download/0.01/stranslate_paddleocr_data_v4.3.zip) 等  > 另: OCR部分软件内置`微信OCR`(1.5.0.402版本开始内置微信OCR数据包，无需依赖外部微信)、词典部分软件内置了`必应`、`金山`词典，上述离线数据包配置较为繁琐，可直接使用软件内置服务

Try: `User-Agent: Dart/3.7 (dart:io)`  ## New Contributors * @Nishantsingh11 made their first contribution in https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/pull/2218 * @Cambrells made their first contribution in https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/pull/2223  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/compare/v1.1.48...v1.1.49
