```
### About  jj is a Git-compatible version control system that is both simple and powerful. See the [installation instructions](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/v0.27.0/install-and-setup/) to get started.  ### Release highlights  * `git.subprocess` is now enabled by default, improving compatibility with Git   fetches and pushes by spawning an external `git` process. Users can opt out   of this by setting `git.subprocess = false`, but this will likely be removed   in a future release. Please report any issues you run into.  ### Breaking changes  * Bookmark name to be created/updated is now parsed as [a revset   symbol](docs/revsets.md#symbols). Quotation may be needed in addition to shell   quotes. Example: `jj bookmark create -r@- "'name with space'"`  * `jj bookmark create`, `jj bookmark set` and `jj bookmark move` onto a hidden    commit make it visible.  * `jj bookmark forget` now untracks any corresponding remote bookmarks instead   of forgetting them, since forgetting a remote bookmark can be unintuitive.   The old behavior is still available with the new `--include-remotes` flag.  * `jj fix` now always sets the working directory of invoked tools to be the   workspace root, instead of the working directory of the `jj fix`.  * The `ui.allow-filesets` configuration option has been removed.   [The "fileset" language](docs/filesets.md) has been enabled by default since v0.20.  * `templates.annotate_commit_summary` is renamed to `templates.file_annotate`,   and now has an implicit `self` parameter of type `AnnotationLine`, instead of   `Commit`. All methods on `Commit` can be accessed with `commit.method()`, or   `self.commit().method()`.  ### Deprecations  * This release takes the first steps to make target revision required in   `bookmark create`, `bookmark move` and `bookmark set`. Those commands will display   a warning if the user does not specify target revision  explicitly. In the near   future those commands will fail if target revision is not specified.  * The `signing.sign-all` config option has been deprecated in favor of   `signing.behavior`. The new option accepts `drop` (never sign), `keep` (preserve   existing signatures), `own` (sign own commits), or `force` (sign all commits).   Existing `signing.sign-all = true` translates to `signing.behavior = "own"`, and   `false` translates to `"keep"`. Invalid configuration is now an error.  ### New features  * The new `jj sign` and `jj unsign` commands allow for signing/unsigning commits.   `jj sign` supports configuring the default revset through `revsets.sign` when   no `--revisions` arguments are provided.  * `jj git fetch` now supports [string pattern syntax](docs/revsets.md#string-patterns)   on `--remote` option and `git.fetch` configuration.  * Template functions `truncate_start()` and `truncate_end()` gained an optional   `ellipsis` parameter; passing this prepends or appends the ellipsis to the   content if it is truncated to fit the maximum width.  * Templates now support `stringify(x)` function and string method   `.escape_json()`. The latter serializes the string in JSON format. It is   useful for making machine-readable templates by escaping problematic   characters like `\n`.  * Templates now support `trim()`, `trim_start()` and `trim_end()` methods   which remove whitespace from the start and end of a `String` type.  * The description of commits backed out by `jj backout` can now be configured   using `templates.backout_description`.  * New `AnnotationLine` templater type. Used in `templates.file_annotate`.   Provides `self.commit()`, `.content()`, `.line_number()`, and   `.first_line_in_hunk()`.  * Templates now have `format_short_operation_id(id)` function for users to   customize the default operation id representation.  * The `jj init`/`jj revert` stubs that print errors can now be overridden with   aliases. All of `jj clone/init/revert` add a hint to a generic error.  * Help text is now colored (when stdout is a terminal).  * Commands that used to suggest `--ignore-immutable` now print the number of   immutable commits that would be rewritten if used and a link to the docs.  * `jj undo` now shows a hint when undoing an undo operation that the user may    be looking for `jj op restore` instead.  ### Fixed bugs  * `jj status` now shows untracked files under untracked directories.   [#5389](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/5389)  * Added workaround for the bug that untracked files are ignored when watchman is   enabled. [#5728](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/5728)  * The `signing.backends.ssh.allowed-signers` configuration option will now   expand `~/` to `$HOME/`.   [#5626](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/pull/5626)  * `config-schema.json` now allows arrays of strings for the settings `ui.editor`   and `ui.diff.tool`.  * `config-schema.json` now allows an array of strings or nested table for the   `ui.pager` setting.  ### Contributors  Thanks to the people who made this release happen!  * Alain Leufroy (@aleufroy) * Aleksey Kuznetsov (@zummenix) * Alexander Mikhailov (@AM5800) * Andrew Gilbert (@andyg0808) * Antoine Martin (@alarsyo) * Anton Bulakh (@necauqua) * Austin Seipp (@thoughtpolice) * Baltasar Dinis (@bsdinis) * Benjamin Tan (@bnjmnt4n) * Bryce Berger (@bryceberger) * Burak Varlƒ± (@unexge) * David Rieber (@drieber) * Emily (@emilazy) * Evan Mesterhazy (@emesterhazy) * George Christou (@gechr) * HKalbasi (@HKalbasi) * Ilya Grigoriev (@ilyagr) * Jacob Hayes (@JacobHayes) * Jonathan Frere (@MrJohz) * Jonathan Tan (@jonathantanmy) * Josh Steadmon (@steadmon) * maan2003 (@maan2003) * Martin von Zweigbergk (@martinvonz) * Matthew Davidson (@KingMob) * Philip Metzger (@PhilipMetzger) * Philipp Albrecht (@pylbrecht) * Roman Timushev (@rtimush) * Samuel Tardieu (@samueltardieu) * Scott Taylor (@scott2000) * Stephan H√ºgel (@urschrei) * Vincent Ging Ho Yim (@cenviity) * Yuya Nishihara (@yuja)

This is the first release of 2025 and comes with an important fix to dunstify. With the roll out of libnotify v0.8.4, older version of dunstify started to not compile or crash when using the -r flag.  If your distribution has updated libnotify, you should update dunstify as soon as possible to resolve these issues.  Other changes include the addition of three dbus signals, the --category option for dunstify, the use of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for reproducible builds.  For more details take a look at the changelog for all the fixes and improvements.  ### Added - Add `urgency`, `stack_tag` and `urls` to dunstctl history (#1425, #1426) - Add `--category` to dunstify (also change `-c` behaviour) (#1429) - Add dbus signals `NotificationHistoryRemoved`, `NotificationHistoryCleared` and `ConfigReloaded` (#1405, #1277)  ### Changed - Allow to override build date with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (#1435) - Flush after printing id in dunstify  ### Fixed - IMPORTANT: Resolve incompatibility between dunstify and  libnotify-0.8.4 (#1443, #1445, #1449) - Fix mixup of `bool` and `gboolean` that caused problems in s390x (#1421, #1422) - Fix some printf warnings and int/gint/size_t mixed uses (#1424) - Fix the scaling of the progress bar gradient (#1447) - Actually reload old config files upon `dunstctl reload` (#1447)   ## New Contributors * @dcermak made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1422 * @BinaryInk made their first contribution in https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/pull/1426  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst/compare/v1.12.1...v1.12.2

Attention maintainers!  In this release we are adding a new client-side syntax to allow the clients to show either shortform or longform options. This should remove a lot of clutter and allow power users to view shortform options by default while showing longform options to new users. The syntax is backwards compatible so there is no need to rush support.  > [!IMPORTANT] > The old https://tldr.sh domain will stop providing assets at the end of this year.  ## Changelog - Added longform/shortform specifications ([#15253](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/15253)) (by @Managor) - Specify `common` as a supported platform option ([#15855](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/15855)) (by @kbdharun) - Add the date of removal of the old asset website ([#15862](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/15862)) (by @acuteenvy) - Various grammar fixes  ## Option placeholders Previously we have used a basic placeholder such as `{{-h|--help}}` to show both the short and long options to the user. While this gave the user more information, it also caused a lot of clutter and reduced the pasteability of the commands. The new option placeholder adds single square brackets inside the placeholder (`{{[-h|--help]}}`) where clients are allowed to pick which one to show. It is recommended for the clients to show only longform options by default, but if a client wants to brand itself as a power user tool they can default to showings shortform options. There is also a backwards compatible presentation style for showing both which is just the curly braces removed (`[-h|--help]`).  ----  ## Style guide improvements If you are a contributor to the tldr pages, do check out the [style guide](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md). We have made several improvements and restructuring to it such as [standardizing keypress notation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md#keypress-syntax), adding instructions for [disambiguation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md#disambiguations) and [grouping](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md#grouping-commands) pages, instructing to avoid using `=` in [option arguments](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md#option-syntax) whenever possible, [example.com clarification](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/style-guide.md#general) and much more.
