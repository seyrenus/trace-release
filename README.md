Wave Terminal v0.11.1 adds a lot of new functionality over v0.11.0 (it could have almost been a v0.12)!  The headline feature is our files/preview widget now supports browsing S3 buckets. We read credential information directly from your ~/.aws/config, and you can now easily select any of your AWS profiles in our connections drop down to start viewing S3 files. We even support editing S3 text files using our built-in editor.  Lots of other features and bug fixes as well:  - **S3 Bucket** directory viewing and file previews - **Drag and Drop Files and Directories** between Wave directory views. This works across machines and between remote machines and S3 conections. - Added json-schema support for some of our config files. You'll now get auto-complete popups for fields in our settings.json, widgets.json, ai.json, and connections.json file. - New block splitting support -- Use Cmd-D and Cmd-Shift-D to split horizontally and vertically. For more control you can use Ctrl-Shift-S and then Up/Down/Left/Right to split in the given direction. - Delete block (without removing it from the layout). You can use Ctrl-Shift-D to remove a block, while keeping it in the layout. you can then launch a new widget in its place. - `wsh file` now supports copying files between your local machine, remote machines, and to/from S3 - New analytics framework (event based as opposed to counter based). See Telemetry Docs for more information. - Web bookmarks! Edit in your bookmarks.json file, can open them in the web widget using Cmd+O - Edits to your ai.json presets file will now take effect _immediately_ in AI widgets - Much better error handling and messaging when errors occur in the preview or editor widget - `wsh ssh --new` added to open the new ssh connection in a new widget - new `wsh launch` command to open any custom widget defined in widget.json - When using terminal multi-input (Ctrl-Shift-I), pasting text will now be sent to all terminals - [bugfix] Fix some hanging goroutines when commands failed or timed out - [bugfix] Fix some file extension mimetypes to enable the editor for more file types - [bugfix] Hitting "tab" would sometimes scroll a widget off screen making it unusable - [bugfix] XDG variables will no longer leak to terminal widgets - Added tailwind CSS and shadcn support to help build new widgets faster - Better internal widget abstractions  ## PRs * Bump github.com/aws/smithy-go from 1.22.1 to

```
## üéâ Introducing Dify Plugins üéâ We are glad to share that we're launching Dify **v1.0.0**.  Plugins are modular components that extend AI applications with plug-and-play simplicity. Now you can assemble external services and custom functionalities with your Dify apps effortlessly.  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c92e96b-ae22-4a2b-b087-276f17038931)   ### What's new - We've developed a plugin system, a standard for Dify that lets users create plugins with the suffix .difypkg. By installing different plugin packages, you can add various capabilities to Dify. - Through this system, we've decoupled tools and models that can be expanded from Dify, enabling you to install them in a truly plug-and-play manner. - We've introduced a new Agent node in Workflow, where the agent's behavior can now be defined by plugins. This means Dify is no longer limited to built-in strategies like CoT; you can define your own agent strategies. - We've also introduced a new type of plugin called Extension, which is a custom service hosted within Dify. You can customize this service's code through plugins to handle external Webhook events. - We've launched the Dify Marketplace, a centralized platform where plugins can be freely shared, allowing users to publish and download different plugins.  ## Docker Deployment v1.0.0 supports Docker compose deployment. You can start Dify using the following commands: bash git checkout 1.0.0 cd ./docker docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d   ## Plugin Migration - !! Note, if you are upgrading from an older version to v1.0.0, you need to execute some basic migration steps. The first step in upgrading to v1.0.0 is to install the tools and models used in your current environment into the new plugin environment, ensuring plugin installation is completed before database migration, run the following command: bash poetry run flask extract-plugins --workers=20  This command extracts all models and tools used in the current environment. The workers parameter determines the number of parallel processes during extraction; adjust it according to your needs. The final result will be saved in the plugins.jsonl file, which contains the plugin information for all workspaces in the current Dify instance. Ensure your network is functioning properly and can access https://marketplace.dify.ai, then run the following command: bash poetry run flask install-plugins --workers=2  This command will download and install all necessary plugins into the latest environment. ## Database Migration After completing the basic plugin installation process, follow the standard Dify upgrade procedure to update the database schema to the latest version. bash poetry run flask db upgrade  Dify v1.0 includes compatibility for old data. You should be able to operate normally, **but for better future compatibility, run the following data migration command once you're sure you won't revert to an older version:** bash poetry run flask migrate-data-for-plugin  This command will prefix existing model and tool vendors in the database with langgenius, such as converting openai to langgenius/openai/openai. This operation may affect the functioning of the older Dify version, so back up your database before running this command to prevent unwanted issues.  **For more detailed migration docs, you can refer to https://docs.dify.ai/development/migration/migrate-to-v1**  ## Chore Changes From v0.15.3  ### üöÄ New Features & Enhancements - **Pan & Zoom**: The MiniMap now comes equipped with pan and zoom support thanks to @KatyTao.  - **Unified Reasoning Model**: Standardized the think tag with `<think></think>` by @junjiem for enhanced compatibility. - **Docker SSRF Settings**: Fine-tuned SSRF-related timeout settings in Docker by @gubinjie. - **HNSW Vector Index**: Now available for TiDB vector store with TiFlash, optimizing how you handle large datasets by @bowenliang123. - **Efficient Retrieval Service**: We‚Äôve doubled down on efficiency, making data retrieval lightning fast by @charli117.   ### üõ†Ô∏è Performance Optimizations & Bug Fixes - **Logical Optimization**: Integration of short-circuit evaluation to optimize logical conditions by @llinvokerl. - **SQL Queries Reduction**: Improved message loading speeds while slicing SQL queries by @hundredwz. - **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplified the workflow by @jiangbo721.  ### üåü New Contributors  A warm welcome to our new contributors!

Huge thanks to @mrexodia     - The main releases are still built with MinGW but this should hopefully make it easier to contribute to ImHex! -  We now provide build attestation for each build generated through our CI so you can verify exactly from which run an artifact has been built -  Added initial support for custom disassemblers     - This lets you define disassemblers for custom instruction sets using a simple [JSON format](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns/tree/master/disassemblers) -  **Added messaging support for macOS and Linux**     - This allows you to use ImHex as a command line tool on macOS and Linux to control the currently open ImHex instance     - For example `imhex --open "SomeFile.bin" --select 0x100 0x200` will open the SomeFile.bin file in the current instance and then select addresses 0x100 to 0x200 -  Added Russian translation! Huge thanks to @Lemon4ksan  -  Added a title bar backdrop color gradients and accent colors -  Added utf16 and utf32 string and char types -  Added option to randomize window title     - In case some stupid anti-cheat is trying to detect ImHex in the future :) -  Added new --select, --pattern and --debug-mode subcommands -  Added support for OpenGL post processing shaders     - This lets you load custom shaders now by placing a `shader.vert` and `shader.frag` file in one of the ImHex resource folders.     - These shaders can apply any post processing to the rendered image -  Added New File option to the GNOME launcher and a --new cli option -  Added support for scanning binaries for UTF-8 strings -  Added visibility toggle to hide bookmark highlighting -  Added option to fit hex columns to screen width -  Added setting to disable hex editor highlights entirely -  Added a preview to the Edit -> Copy as options -  Added "Jump to address" option to data inspector row context menu -  Added option to change radix of numbers in hex editor view -  Added context menu and next/previous buttons to the data inspector -  Added option to move selection back to hex editor footer -  Added option to copy data as escaped string -  Added shortcut for Copy as -> Custom Encoding  ## Improvements  -  **Replaced the Windows and Linux app icon with the one from the Papyrus Icon Project!** -  The DMG on macOS now looks a lot nicer than before -  Revamped the frame rate limiting system to make ImHex feel much less laggy by default and make it use less CPU resources -  ImHex now uses Jetbrains Mono as its default font instead of the ImGui default font -  The settings window can now be resized -  The ImHex window is now hidden on macOS when close button is pressed -  Allowed all highlights to overlap each other -  Allowed the favorite column in the pattern data view to be hidden -  Allowed command palette to be closed by clicking on the menu bar -  All installed content store items are now force updated after an ImHex update  ## Bug Fixes  -  Fixed various issues with the auto updater -  RGBA8 data processor node not working correctly -  Very slow processing of large pattern console outputs -  Windows forwarder application not working when piping output -  Writing not working correctly through a provider view -  Crash on Linux if XDG_SESSION_TYPE is not set -  Crash when closing ImHex with one or more view providers open -  Uninitialized buffers in resize operation -  Exception being thrown while loading projects -  Crash when certain pattern language exceptions were thrown -  Pattern Editor shortcuts not working correctly on different languages (#2085) -  Pattern Editor Find and Replace history (#2064) -  Crash in 3D Visualizer, improved error messages (#2062) -  Disable bogus Keypad to function key conversions on macOS -  Empty regions in Intel Hex and Motorola SREC files not being displayed correctly -  Make sure provider switch buttons and close button don't overlap -  Hang when filtering for a large number of items in the pattern data view -  Off-by-one when calculating hashes of selected regions -  ImHex freezing on AMD GPUs when resizing -  Rendering issues with text editor in bookmark view -  Ctrl sometimes getting stuck when pressing ALT GR and other keys at the same time -  Missing endian setting in ARM64 disassembler -  Clicking past end of line in text editor putting cursor before last character  ## Pattern Language  - **The evaluator now tries to keep as many patterns as it possibly can when an error occurs** -  Added cursor positions to the error stack traces -  Exported global variables are now displayed in the output -  Added support for rvalue assignments inside of structs -  Fixed various issues when importing patterns as types -  Make decompress functions return number of read bytes -  Allow #pragma magic to index from the end of the data with negative addresses -  Fixed error spam when encountering an error in the Lexer   <p align="center">If you like my work, please consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors, Patreon or PayPal.

### 2025-02-27T13:03:02Z [**fish-shell/fish-shell**](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

```
fish‚Äôs core code has been ported from C++ to Rust ([#9512](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9512)). This means a large change in dependencies and how to build fish. However, there should be no direct impact on users. Packagers should see the [For Distributors](#rust-packaging) section at the end.  ### Notable backwards-incompatible changes  - As part of a larger binding rework, `bind` gained a new key notation.   In most cases the old notation should keep working, but in rare cases you may have to change a `bind` invocation to use the new notation.   See [below](#changelog-new-bindings) for details. - `ctrl-c` now calls a new bind function called `clear-commandline`. The old behavior, which leaves a ‚Äú^C‚Äù marker, is available as `cancel-commandline` ([#10935](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10935)) - `random` will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.   The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,   so we do not expect this to have a large impact ([#9593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9593)). - Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.   For example, `set editor command emacs; $editor` is no longer allowed ([#10249](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10249)). - `functions --handlers` will now list handlers in a different order.   Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.   This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order ([#9944](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9944)). - The `qmark-noglob` feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means `?` will no longer act as a single-character glob.   You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding `no-qmark-noglob` to `fish_features` and restarting fish:   fish-docs-samples   set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob       The flag will eventually be made read-only, making it impossible to turn off. - Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool-retro-term and emacs‚Äô ansi-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not. - fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user `$PATH` environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the `/mnt/c/...` path is explicitly added to `$fish_user_paths` and not just automatically appended to `$PATH` by `wsl.exe` ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)). - Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a `SIGHUP` + `SIGCONT` sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into `SIGTTOU` remain in a suspended state indefinitely ([#5263](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263)). The workaround is to explicitly `disown` processes you wish to outlive the shell session.  ### Notable improvements and fixes  <a id="changelog-new-bindings"></a> - fish now requests XTerm‚Äôs `modifyOtherKeys` keyboard encoding and [kitty keyboard protocol‚Äôs](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) progressive enhancements ([#10359](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10359)).   Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers `ctrl`, `alt` and `shift`, and distinguishing (for example) `ctrl-i` from `tab`.    Additionally, `bind` now supports a human-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.   This includes modifier names, and names for keys like `enter` and `backspace`.   For example   - `bind up 'do something'` binds the up-arrow key instead of a two-key sequence (‚Äúu‚Äù and then ‚Äúp‚Äù)   - `bind ctrl-x,alt-c 'do something'` binds a sequence of two keys.    Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like `\e` or `\cX`) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain `,` or `-` will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.    Keyboard protocols can be turned off by disabling the ‚Äúkeyboard-protocols‚Äù feature flag:   fish-docs-samples   set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols       This is a temporary measure to work around buggy terminals ([#11056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11056)), which appear to be relatively rare.   Use this if something like ‚Äú=0‚Äù or ‚Äú=5u‚Äù appears in your commandline mysteriously. - fish can now be built as a self-installing binary ([#10367](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10367)). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.   To do this, run:   fish-docs-samples   cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository   # or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want       The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  `~/.local/share/fish/install/`. A specific path can be used for the data files with `fish --install=PATH` To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.    This build system is experimental; the main build system, using `cmake`, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix. - A new function `fish_should_add_to_history` can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history ([#10302](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10302)). - Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so `bind ctrl-g expand-abbr "commandline -i \n"` works as expected ([#8186](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186)). - Special input functions run from bindings via `commandline -f` are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding ([#3031](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031), [#10126](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126)).   For example, `commandline -i foo; commandline | grep foo` succeeds now. - Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process. - The `ctrl-r` history search now uses glob syntax ([#10131](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131)). - The `ctrl-r` history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history ([#9751](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751)). - Abbreviations can now be restricted to specific commands. For instance:   fish-docs-samples   abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'       will expand ‚Äúback‚Äù to `reset --hard HEAD^`, but only when the command is `git` ([#9411](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411)).  ### Deprecations and removed features  - `commandline --tokenize` (short option `-o`) has been deprecated in favor of `commandline --tokens-expanded` (short option `-x`) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use [eval](cmds/eval.md) in completion scripts ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)). - Two new feature flags:   - `remove-percent-self` (see `status features`) disables PID expansion of `%self`, which has been supplanted by `$fish_pid` ([#10262](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10262)).   - `test-require-arg` disables `test`‚Äôs one-argument mode. That means `test -n` without an additional argument will return false, `test -z` will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for `[`, test‚Äôs alternate name.     This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.     In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category ‚Äúdeprecated-test‚Äù. Running fish with `fish -d deprecated-test` will show warnings whenever a `test` invocation that would change is used. ([#10365](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10365)).    These can be enabled with:   fish-docs-samples   set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg       We intend to enable them by default in future, and after that eventually make them read-only. - Specifying key names as terminfo names (using the `bind -k` syntax) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version. - When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special `paste` bind mode.   This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable. - When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.   If this happens, you can use the `reset` command from `ncurses` to restore the terminal state. - `fish_key_reader --verbose` no longer shows timing information. - Terminal information is no longer read from hashed terminfo databases, or termcap databases ([#10269](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10269)). The vast majority of systems use a non-hashed terminfo database, which is still supported. - `source` returns an error if used without a filename or pipe/redirection ([#10774](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774)).  ### Scripting improvements  - `for` loops will no longer remember local variables from the previous iteration ([#10525](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525)). - A new `history append` subcommand appends a command to the history, without executing it ([#4506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506)). - A new redirection: `<? /path/to/file` will try opening the file as input, and if it doesn‚Äôt succeed silently uses `/dev/null` instead.   This can help with checks like `test -f /path/to/file; and string replace foo bar < /path/to/file`. ([#10387](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10387)) - A new option `commandline --tokens-raw` prints a list of tokens without any unescaping ([#10212](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212)). - A new option `commandline --showing-suggestion` tests whether an autosuggestion is currently displayed ([#10586](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10586)). - `functions` and `type` now show that a function was copied and its source, rather than solely `Defined interactively` ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)). - Stack trace now shows line numbers for copied functions ([#6575](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575)). - `foo & && bar` is now a syntax error, like in other shells ([#9911](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911)). - `if -e foo; end` now prints a more accurate error ([#10000](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10000)). - `cd` into a directory that is not readable but accessible (permissions `--x`) is now possible ([#10432](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432)). - An integer overflow in `string repeat` leading to a near-infinite loop has been fixed ([#9899](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899)). - `string shorten` behaves better in the presence of non-printable characters, including fixing an integer overflow that shortened strings more than intended ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)). - `string pad` no longer allows non-printable characters as padding ([#9854](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854)). - `string repeat` now allows omission of `-n` when the first argument is an integer ([#10282](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10282)). - `string match` and `replace` have a new `--max-matches` option to return as soon as the specified number of matches have been identified, which can improve performance in scripts ([#10587](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10587)). - `functions --handlers-type caller-exit` once again lists functions defined as `function --on-job-exit caller`, rather than them being listed by `functions --handlers-type process-exit`. - A new `set --no-event` option sets or erases variables without triggering a variable event. This can be useful to change a variable in an event handler ([#10480](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10480)). - Commas in command substitution output are no longer used as separators in brace expansion, preventing a surprising expansion in some cases ([#5048](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048)). - Universal variables can now store strings containing invalid UTF-8 ([#10313](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313)). - A new `path basename -E` option that causes it to return the basename (‚Äúfilename‚Äù with the directory prefix removed) with the final extension (if any) also removed. This is a shorter version of `path change-extension "" (path basename $foo)` ([#10521](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10521)). - A new `math --scale-mode` option to select `truncate`, `round`, `floor`, `ceiling` as you wish; the default value is `truncate`. ([#9117](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117)). - `random` is now less strict about its arguments, allowing a start larger or equal to the end. ([#10879](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879)) - `function --argument-names` now produces an error if a read-only variable name is used, rather than simply ignoring it ([#10842](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842)). - Tilde expansion in braces (that is, `{~,}`) works correctly ([#10610](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610)).  ### Interactive improvements  - Autosuggestions were sometimes not shown after recalling a line from history, which has been fixed ([#10287](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287)). - Up-arrow search matches -- which are highlighted in reverse colors -- are no longer syntax-highlighted, to fix bad contrast with the search match highlighting. - Command abbreviations (those with `--position command` or without a `--position`) now also expand after decorators like `command` ([#10396](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10396)). - Abbreviations now expand after process separators like `;` and `|`. This fixes a regression in version 3.6 ([#9730](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730)). - When exporting interactively defined functions (using `type`, `functions` or `funcsave`) the function body is now indented, to match the interactive command line editor ([#8603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8603)). - `ctrl-x` (`fish_clipboard_copy`) on multiline commands now includes indentation ([#10437](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10437)). - `ctrl-v` (`fish_clipboard_paste`) now strips ASCII control characters from the pasted text.   This is consistent with normal keyboard input ([#5274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274)). - When a command like `fg %2` fails to find the given job, it no longer behaves as if no job spec was given ([#9835](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835)). - Redirection in command position like `>echo` is now highlighted as error ([#8877](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877)). - `fish_vi_cursor` now works properly inside the prompt created by builtin `read` ([#10088](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088)). - fish no longer fails to open a FIFO if interrupted by a terminal resize signal ([#10250](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250)). - `read --help` and friends no longer ignore redirections. This fixes a regression in version 3.1 ([#10274](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274)). - Measuring a command with `time` now considers the time taken for command substitution ([#9100](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100)). - `fish_add_path` now automatically enables verbose mode when used interactively (in the command line), in an effort to be clearer about what it does ([#10532](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10532)). - fish no longer adopts TTY modes of failed commands ([#10603](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10603)). - `complete -e cmd` now prevents autoloading completions for `cmd` ([#6716](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716)). - fish‚Äôs default color scheme no longer uses the color ‚Äúblue‚Äù, as it has bad contrast against the background in a few terminal‚Äôs default palettes ([#10758](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10758), [#10786](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786))   The color scheme will not be upgraded for existing installs. If you want, you should select it again via `fish_config`. - Command lines which are larger than the terminal are now displayed correctly, instead of multiple blank lines being displayed ([#7296](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296)). - Prompts that use external commands will no longer produce an infinite loop if the command crashes ([#9796](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796)). - Undo (`ctrl-z`) restores the cursor position too ([#10838](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10838)). - The output of `jobs` shows ‚Äú-‚Äù for jobs that have the same process group ID as the fish process, rather than ‚Äú-2‚Äù ([#10833](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10833)). - Job expansion (`%1` syntax) works properly for jobs that are a mixture of external commands and functions ([#10832](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832)). - Command lines which have more lines than the terminal can be displayed and edited correctly ([#10827](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827)). - Functions that have been erased are no longer highlighted as valid commands ([#10866](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866)). - `not`, `time`, and variable assignments (that is `not time a=b env`) is correctly recognized as valid syntax ([#10890](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10890)). - The Web-based configuration removes old right-hand-side prompts again, fixing a regression in fish 3.4.0 ([#10675](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675)). - Further protection against programs which crash and leave the terminal in an inconsistent state ([#10834](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834), [#11038](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038)). - A workaround for git being very slow on macOS has been applied, improving performance after a fresh boot ([#10535](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535)).  #### New or improved bindings  - When the cursor is on a command that resolves to an executable script, `alt-o` will now open that script in your editor ([#10266](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10266)). - During up-arrow history search, `shift-delete` will delete the current search item and move to the next older item. Previously this was only supported in the history pager. - `shift-delete` will also remove the currently-displayed autosuggestion from history, and remove it as a suggestion. - `ctrl-Z` (also known as `ctrl-shift-z`) is now bound to redo. - Some improvements to the `alt-e` binding which edits the command line in an external editor:   - The editor‚Äôs cursor position is copied back to fish. This is currently supported for Vim and Kakoune.   - Cursor position synchronization is only supported for a set of known editors, which are now also detected in aliases which use `complete --wraps`. For example, use `complete --wraps my-vim vim` to synchronize cursors when `EDITOR=my-vim`.   - Multiline commands are indented before being sent to the editor, which matches how they are displayed in fish. - The `...-path-component` bindings, like `backward-kill-path-component`, now treat `#` as part of a path component ([#10271](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271)). - Bindings like `alt-l` that print output in between prompts now work correctly with multiline commandlines. - `alt-d` on an empty command line lists the directory history again. This restores the behavior of version 2.1. - `history-prefix-search-backward` and `-forward` now maintain the cursor position, instead of moving the cursor to the end of the command line ([#10430](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430)). - The following keys have refined behavior if the terminal supports [the new keyboard encodings](#changelog-new-bindings):   - `shift-enter` now inserts a newline instead of executing the command line.   - `ctrl-backspace` now deletes the last word instead of only one character ([#10741](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741)).   - `ctrl-delete` deletes the next word (same as `alt-d`). - New special input functions:   - `forward-char-passive` and `backward-char-passive` are like their non-passive variants but do not accept autosuggestions or move focus in the completion pager ([#10398](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10398)).   - `forward-token`, `backward-token`, `kill-token`, and `backward-kill-token` are similar to the `*-bigword` variants but for the whole argument token (which includes escaped spaces) ([#2014](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014)).   - `clear-commandline`, which merely clears the command line, as an alternative to `cancel-commandline` which prints `^C` and a new prompt ([#10213](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10213)). - The `accept-autosuggestion` special input function now returns false when there was nothing to accept ([#10608](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10608)). - Vi mode has seen some improvements but continues to suffer from the lack of people working on it.   - New default cursor shapes for insert and replace mode.   - `ctrl-n` in insert mode accepts autosuggestions ([#10339](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10339)).   - Outside insert mode, the cursor will no longer be placed beyond the last character on the commandline.   - When the cursor is at the end of the commandline, a single `l` will accept an autosuggestion ([#10286](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286)).   - The cursor position after pasting (`p`) has been corrected.   - Added an additional binding, `_`, for moving to the beginning of the line ([#10720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10720)).   - When the cursor is at the start of a line, escaping from insert mode no longer moves the cursor to the previous line.   - Added bindings for clipboard interaction, like `",+,p` and `",+,y,y`.   - Deleting in visual mode now moves the cursor back, matching vi ([#10394](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394)).   - The `;`, `,`, `v`, `V`, `I`, and `gU` bindings work in visual mode ([#10601](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10601), [#10648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648)).   - Support `%` motion ([#10593](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10593)).   - `ctrl-k` to remove the contents of the line beyond the cursor in all modes ([#10648](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648)).   - Support ab and ib vi text objects. New input functions are introduced `jump-{to,till}-matching-bracket` ([#1842](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842)).   - The `E` binding now correctly handles the last character of the word, by jumping to the next word ([#9700](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9700)).  #### Completions  - Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete `git add` for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period ([#3707](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707)). - Option completion now uses fuzzy subsequence filtering, just like non-option completion ([#830](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830)).   This means that `--fb` may be completed to `--foobar` if there is no better match. - Completions that insert an entire token now use quotes instead of backslashes to escape special characters ([#5433](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433)). - Normally, file name completions start after the last `:`  or `=` in a token.   This helps commands like `rsync --files-from=`.   This special meaning can now disabled by escaping these separators as `\:` and `\=`.   This matches Bash‚Äôs behavior.   Note that this escaping is usually not necessary since the completion engine already tries   to guess whether the separator is actually part of a file name. - Various new completion scripts and numerous updates to existing ones. - Completions could hang if the `PAGER` environment variable was sent to certain editors on macOS, FreeBSD and some other platforms. This has been fixed ([#10820](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820)). - Generated completions are now stored in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish` or `~/.cache/fish` by default ([#10369](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369)) - A regression in fish 3.1, where completing a command line could change it completely, has been fixed ([#10904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904)).  #### Improved terminal support  - fish now marks the prompt and command-output regions (via OSC 133) to enable terminal shell integration ([#10352](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10352)).   Shell integration shortcuts can scroll to the next/previous prompt or show the last command output in a pager. - fish now reports the working directory (via OSC 7) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#9955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955)). - fish now sets the terminal window title (via OSC 0) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals ([#10037](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10037)). - Focus reporting in tmux is no longer disabled on the first prompt. - Focus reporting is now disabled during commands run inside key bindings ([#6942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942)). - Cursor changes are applied to all terminals that support them, and the list of specifically-supported terminals has been removed ([#10693](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10693)). - If it cannot find the terminfo entry given by [`TERM`](language.md#envvar-TERM) environment variable, fish will now use an included `xterm-256color` definition to match the vast majority of current terminal emulators ([#10905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10905)). If you need to have a specific terminfo profile for your terminal‚Äôs `TERM` variable, install it into the terminfo database. - Further improvements to the correct display of prompts which fill the width of the terminal ([#8164](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164)).  ### Other improvements  - `status` gained a `buildinfo` subcommand, to print information on how fish was built, to help with debugging ([#10896](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10896)). - `fish_indent` will now collapse multiple empty lines into one ([#10325](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10325)). - `fish_indent` now preserves the modification time of files if there were no changes ([#10624](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10624)). - Performance in launching external processes has been improved for many cases ([#10869](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10869)). - Performance and interactivity under Windows Subsystem for Linux has been improved, with a workaround for Windows-specific locations being appended to `$PATH` by default ([#10506](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506)). - On macOS, paths from `/etc/paths` and `/etc/manpaths` containing colons are handled correctly ([#10684](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684)). - Additional filesystems such as AFS are properly detected as remote, which avoids certain hangs due to expensive filesystem locks ([#10818](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10818)). - A spurious error when launching multiple instances of fish for the first time has been removed ([#10813](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813)).  <a id="rust-packaging"></a>  ### For distributors  fish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).  CMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo‚Äôs limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer ([#9924](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924)). CMake builds default to optimized release builds ([#10799](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10799)).  fish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.  The `test` target was removed as it can no longer be defined in new CMake versions. Use `make fish_run_tests`. Any existing test target will not print output if it fails ([#11116](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116)).  The Web-based configuration has been rewritten to use Alpine.js ([#9554](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9554)).  ### Changes since fish 4.0b1  A number of improvements were included in fish 4.0.0 following the beta release of 4.0b1. These include fixes for regressions, improvements to completions and documentation, and the removal of a small number of problematic changes.  The full list of fixed issues can be found on the [GitHub milestone page for 4.0-final](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/43).  *Download links: To download the source code for fish, use the file named "fish-4.0.0.tar.xz".

A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available  is available as "fish-4.0.0.tar.xz.asc".*  *The files called `fish-static-*` are experimental statically linked builds for any linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed*
