## Release Notes  This is a follow-up to [release 0.10.0](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/0.10.0). The `requires-python` inference changes were unintentionally omitted from 0.10.0, and have been included here. This release also includes stabilization of the preview behavior for `PGH004`.  ### Breaking changes  - **Changes to how the Python version is inferred when a `target-version` is not specified** ([#16319](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16319))      In previous versions of Ruff, you could specify your Python version with:      - The `target-version` option in a `ruff.toml` file or the `[tool.ruff]` section of a pyproject.toml file.     - The `project.requires-python` field in a `pyproject.toml` file with a `[tool.ruff]` section.      These options worked well in most cases, and are still recommended for fine control of the Python version. However, because of the way Ruff discovers config files, `pyproject.toml` files without a `[tool.ruff]` section would be ignored, including the `requires-python` setting. Ruff would then use the default Python version (3.9 as of this writing) instead, which is surprising when you've attempted to request another version.      In v0.10, config discovery has been updated to address this issue:      - If Ruff finds a `ruff.toml` file without a `target-version`, it will check         for a `pyproject.toml` file in the same directory and respect its         `requires-python` version, even if it does not contain a `[tool.ruff]`         section.     - If Ruff finds a user-level configuration, the `requires-python` field of the closest `pyproject.toml` in a parent directory will take precedence.     - If there is no config file (`ruff.toml`or `pyproject.toml` with a         `[tool.ruff]` section) in the directory of the file being checked, Ruff will         search for the closest `pyproject.toml` in the parent directories and use its         `requires-python` setting.  ### Stabilization  The following behaviors have been stabilized:  - [`blanket-noqa`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blanket-noqa/) (`PGH004`): Also detect blanked file-level noqa comments (and not just line level comments).  ### Preview features  - [syntax-errors] Tuple unpacking in `for` statement iterator clause before Python 3.9 ([#16558](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16558))  ##

## Changelog  Following over a year of development, I am proud to announce that Maple Mono v7.0 stable is now available.  I have made a [website](https://font.subf.dev) to introduce the font and provide a playground for OpenType features. It's a little minimal and buggy,  but I will continuously improve its functionality.  The changes from v7.0-beta36 mainly are: - bolden slash in `!=` / `=/=` #334 - add `cv37` for italic `y`  And, this is not an end. More features will come out in v7.1, you can view the details in the [milestone](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/milestone/1)  ## Download  [Which File to

### 2025-03-13T03:25:12Z [**fish-shell/fish-shell**](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

```
This release of fish includes the following improvements compared to fish 4.0.0:  - Key combinations using the super (Windows/command) key can be bound using the `super-` prefix ([#11217](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11217)). - Konsole’s menu shows the “Open folder with” option again ([#11198](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11198)). - `$fish_color_search_match` will now only be applied to the foreground color if it has an explicit foreground. For example, this allows setting:   `set -g fish_color_search_match --reverse` - Cursor shape commands (`\e[2 q`) are no longer sent in non-interactive shells or in redirections ([#11255](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11255)). - [status](cmds/status.md) gained a `is-interactive-read` subcommand, to check whether the script is being called from an interactive [read](cmds/read.md) invocation. - fish’s background tasks are now started in a way that avoids an error on macOS Terminal.app ([#11181](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11181)). - Using key combinations within qemu should work correctly. - Prompts containing control characters no longer cause incorrect display of command lines ([#11252](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11252)). - Cancelling the command-line in Vi mode displays correctly again ([#11261](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11261)). - The acidhub prompt properly displays the git branch again ([#11179](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11179)). - Completions for `wine` correctly include files again ([#11202](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11202)). - On macOS, paths from `/etc/paths` and `/etc/manpaths` containing colons are handled correctly ([#10684](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684)). This functionality was included in the 4.0.0 release notes but was missing from the source code. - The XTerm `modifyOtherKeys` keyboard encoding is no longer used under WezTerm, as it does not work correctly in all layouts ([#11204](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11204)). - `option-left` and other similar keys should now work in iTerm versions before 3.5.12; the kitty keyboard protocol is now disabled on these versions ([#11192](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11192)). - The kitty keyboard protocol is no longer used under Midnight Commander, as it does not work correctly ([#10640](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10640)). - fish now sends the commandline along with the OSC 133 semantic prompt command start sequence. This fixes a test in the kitty terminal ([#11203](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11203)). - Git completions for third-party commands like “git-absorb” are completed correctly again ([#11205](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11205)). - Completions for `diskutil` no longer produce an error ([#11201](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11201)). - The output of certain error messages no longer prints newlines to standard output ([#11248](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11248)). - A number of crashes have been fixed, including file names longer than 255 bytes ([#11221](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11221)), using fish on a btrfs filesystem ([#11219](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11219)), history files that do not have the expected format ([#11236](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11236)), and pasting into an empty command line ([#11256](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11256)).  *Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named "fish-4.0.1.tar.xz". The file downloaded from "Source code (tar.gz)" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `4ed63a70207283e15cf21fc5f21db4230421e4f98d4826b5b1c8254d69c762b5`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A` is available as "fish-4.0.1.tar.xz.asc".*  *The files called fish-static-\* are experimental, statically linked builds, for any Linux with the given architecture. Extract and run, and they will extract their data files as needed.*
