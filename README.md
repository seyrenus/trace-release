# 🌟 What's New in v1.4.0? 🌟  🎂 Dify turns 2! New look, new brand, same mission.  Imagine if every idea could become an AI agent. With Dify, ‘if’ you can ask it, you can build it.  Check out the new [Dify.AI](http://dify.ai/) and start building your **if** today.  ## 🚀 New Features & Enhancements  <img width="1882" alt="features" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/314be691-d130-4d9b-8f18-537613a2b44e" />  ### 🌙 Dark Mode  We’ve rolled out a theme switcher that allows you to easily toggle between light and dark modes, perfect for those late-night coding sessions. Click your avatar to experience it! This feature helps reduce eye strain and allows you to customize your user interface to match your preference. Thanks to @JzoNgKVO in PR #18093 for making this possible.  ### 🖼️ Multi-Modal LLM Output  Our platform now supports multimodal outputs, allowing LLMs to handle both text and images within the LLMNode. This feature enhances the richness of data interaction and boosts your model's capabilities, courtesy of @QuantumGhost's efforts in PR #17372. You can now try these new features using the Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model! This integration ensures that your AI can process and respond with both text and visual data seamlessly.  ### ✏️ Editable Questions  We’ve added greater control over your questions, allowing them to be edited before they go live. This update ensures that you can tweak questions for clarity and relevance, as implemented by @HyaCiovo in PR #19117.  ## 🔧 Bug Fixes and Improvements  - **Enhanced Redis Management**: Support Redis client-side caching for optimized data handling (though it’s disabled out-of-the-box), improving overall system performance. Credits to @bowenliang123 in PRs #19493 and #19524.    - **Robust Workflow Management**: Addressed numerous inconsistencies and bugs in workflows, ensuring smoother, more reliable operations across the board. Our workflows can now handle node failures more gracefully, thanks to contributions from @Kevin9703 in PR #18994.  These features and improvements reflect the feedback from our amazing community and aim to elevate both usability and functionality. We hope these updates significantly enhance your user experience!  Big thanks to all contributors for steering this version forward. Happy experimenting! 🙌  ---  ## Upgrade Guide  ### Docker Compose Deployments  1.

# 1.7.9  ## Custom commands on events  Giomatfois62 added a nice feature that allows you to execute a custom command on different events. For example play a sound when accepting an entry.  See the [rofi-actions(5)](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/1.7.9/doc/rofi-actions.5.markdown) manpage for more information.  ## NVidia workaround workaround  Because of oddness in nvidia drivers, we had an issue the whole screen turned black if we used the 'over' operator in cairo. Working around this caused some drawing issues with anti-aliasing. There now exists two flags to to work around this workaround again. Either disable the workaround, or disable anti-aliasing.  You can set these options per widget:  css widget {   border-disable-nvidia-workaround: true;   border-aa: false; }   It's recommended to set it globally.  css * {   border-disable-nvidia-workaround: true;   border-aa: false; }   ## IMDKit runtime disable option  Because IMDKit can break some keybindings, this can now be disabled at runtime. For example if you try to bind only the 'Super' key, this can fix this.  For more information, see issue: #2124  ## Smartcase support  Thanks to Phanium, rofi now supports Vim style 'smartcase'. Can be enabled using `-case-smart`.  Fore more information, see issue: #2060  ## Changelog  * Add -imdkit config to toggle imdkit at runtime (#2124) (thx Amos Bird) * [Widget] Add 2 workaround for error in corner radius drawing * [rofi-sensible-terminal] Add ghostty (#2110) * [scrollbar] Add theming for rounded corners (#2108) (thx J0hannes101) * [DOC] Fix indenting of sub-bullets as mkdocs interpets them differently (#2112) * Fix typo in fullscreen-preview.rasi (#2113) (thx elig0n) * Add theming to hide text cursor if no text is put in (#2106) (thx J0hannes101) * [DRUN] Add option to exclude categories from drun #2102 (#2104) (thx J0hannes101) * [XCB] Don't keep casting from int to double to int * [Helper] Add a rofi_fallthrough macro to tell compiler fallthrough is intentional * [View] xcb_clear_area  fixed wrong argument order. * [DRun] Better handling of corrupted cache file. * Fix broken Pango link (#2096) (thx Emil) * [NKUtils] Drop support for binding Meta key. (#2095) * [View] Allow cycling through matching methods (#2091) * Fix wrong pointer `-replace` and small cleanup. * [Textbox] Small signedness fixes for password mask code. * [dmenu] Modified textbox password masking (#2067) (thx Zebra2711) * add smartcase support like vim (#2060) (thx Phanium) * [Mode] Fix wrong documentation header. * Execute custom user commands or scripts on a variety of rofi events (#2053) (thx giomatfois62) * Add option to enable the `kb-delete-entry` in script mode (#2087) (thx Tiou Lims) * [Window] Allow active window to be sorted on top. (#2048) * [Lexer] Allow for optional imports. (#2078)
