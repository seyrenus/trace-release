# What’s new in Novu 0.23?  **TL;DR:** All you need to know about the latest Novu 0.23.0 release. Translation management, provider integrations, notification center updates, performance updates, and more!  ## 0.23 Release Updates  We're excited to highlight the newest features introduced in our latest release. Join us as we explore what awaits you!  ![giphy (7)](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/04bc5fcc-228d-4430-b71d-bc8e6c1e7162)  ## Translation Management  💡Note: This feature is only available for **Novu Cloud for Business** and **Enterprise** Clients.  The translation management feature allows users to create, upload, and edit translation groups and files from the Novu dashboard.  It’s new and we’re excited for you to start using it in your apps!  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jfpku2po56hi92wmvi5s.png)  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gwndpnemqd219isuikja.png)  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/657glfdikc7q2iql66a6.png)  With this feature comes a new handlebar helper for translations, `{{ i18n ... }}`. Novu users can now translate their notification templates to different languages using the `i18n` handlebar helper and the translation keys in the editor.  ![image](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2607232/0b9c5556-dbec-4bc4-b5f4-de7ecc6bb82a)  ## **Support for Non-Root User (UID 1000)**  In our continued effort to enhance security and compatibility in enterprise environments, we are proud to announce a significant update aimed at supporting systems with restricted root access.  **Key Features:**  - **Non-Root User Support**: Novu now officially supports deployment under a non-root user with a fixed UID of 1000. This update is crucial for enterprise deployments on systems that enforce strict no-root policies, ensuring compliance with security best practices. - **Seamless Integration**: This enhancement facilitates smoother integration of Novu into secure environments, reducing the need for workarounds or exceptions in security policies. - **Enhanced Security**: Running Novu under a non-root user reduces potential security risks and aligns with the principle of least privilege, further safeguarding our notification infrastructure.  **Getting Started:**  No action is required from your side to take advantage of this update. The changes have been seamlessly integrated into Novu, ensuring that your enterprise deployments comply with non-root user policies without any additional configuration needed.  ## ARM Image Support  We're thrilled to share that Novu has officially introduced support for ARM images, marking a significant step in our dedication to embracing innovation and responsibility within the tech landscape. This development ensures that Novu stays ahead in the realm of notification infrastructure by broadening our platform's accessibility, compatibility, and sustainability.  **Key Highlights:**  - **ARM Architecture Support**: Users can now deploy Novu on systems powered by ARM processors, benefiting from the efficiency and performance improvements that ARM architectures offer. - **Optimized Performance**: ARM support brings optimized performance for ARM-based deployments, ensuring faster and more efficient notification processing.  **Getting Started with ARM Images:**  To use Novu on an ARM-based system, simply pull the ARM-compatible Docker image from our registry. If you are on a not a ARM based system you can use the following command in docker to pull the image.  `docker pull --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/novuhq/novu:v0.23.0`  💡Note: Emulating ARM hardware may be slower then running an ARM image on ARM hardware.  ## Deprecation of Original Notifire Packages  Novu has evolved so much from when it was originally created. On the release of v0.24.0, we will be deprecating the original Notifire packages hosted on GitHub and any package within the `@notifire` namespace on NPM.  The following packages hosted on GitHub under the `novuhq` organization are scheduled for deprecation:  ### Deprecated Packages  1. **[Notifire WebSocket Package (`notifire/ws`)](https://github.com/orgs/novuhq/packages/container/package/notifire%2Fws)** 2. **[Notifire Widget Package (`notifire/widget`)](https://github.com/orgs/novuhq/packages/container/package/notifire%2Fwidget)** 3. **[Notifire SDK Package (`notifire/sdk`)](https://github.com/orgs/novuhq/packages/container/package/notifire%2Fsdk)** 4. **[Notifire Web Package (`notifire/web`)](https://github.com/orgs/novuhq/packages/container/package/notifire%2Fweb)** 5. **[Notifire API Package (`notifire/api`)](https://github.com/orgs/novuhq/packages/container/package/notifire%2Fapi)**  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qeno0vl934pl6zdrkuzi.png)  ### NPM Namespace Deprecation  All packages within the [@notifire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifire/core) namespace on NPM are also scheduled for deprecation. This includes any package prefixed with `@notifire/`, ensuring a comprehensive and clear transition away from these older offerings.  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oarswtqejwjuuj8r0el0.png)  Users currently relying on these deprecated packages should promptly transition to the official `@novu` packages.  ## Field-level Encryption to API Keys  We're security conscious at Novu. The API keys are now encrypted at rest in the database and hashed at rest in the cache.  We added this security feature to prevent direct use of the API key in the event of a database breach or bad actor trying to use the key with bad intentions.  **Note:** All existing API keys become encrypted [through a data migration script](https://docs.novu.co/additional-resources/data-migrations) for **self-hosted** users. Running the script more than once does not re-encrypt the api keys.  ## Bulk Delete Notifications in Notification Center  Users can now remove multiple notifications using an array of message ids (limit of 100) via the [Notification center hooks](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/react/api-reference#useremovenotifications) and [Headless library](https://docs.novu.co/notification-center/client/headless/api-reference#removenotifications).  **Notification Center Hook**  jsx const onSuccess = (data: IMessage) => {};  const onError = (error: Error) => {};  const { removeNotifications, isLoading, isError, error } = useRemoveNotifications({   onSuccess,   onError, });   **Headless Service**  jsx headlessService.removeNotifications({   listener: (     result: UpdateResult<IMessage, unknown, { messageId: string }>   ) => {     console.log(result);   },   onSuccess: (message: IMessage) => {     console.log(message);   },   onError: (error: unknown) => {     console.error(error);   },   messageIds: ["message_id_1", "message_id_2" ], });    ## Rocket Chat Provider Integration  You can now send Chat messages via the Rocket Chat provider integration:  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uqt8ik36poeunhhci8kc.png)  ## Brevo (SendInBlue) SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS messages via the Brevo SMS provider integration:  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4rjtyos91922zbkoct7z.png)  ## iSend SMS Provider Integration  You can now send SMS via the [iSend](https://send.com.ly/) sms provider integration:  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q2ie74y13mnr3h787g63.png)  ## CustomData Overrides for SMS  A `customData` overrides provider for SMS now exists. This property allows us to support provider specific configurations in future for SMS providers.  For now, it only supports DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) for the Gupshup SMS provider.  *Trigger workflow with customData*  jsx novu.trigger("gupshup-workflow", {   to: {     subscriberId: "1234",   },   payload: {     user: "Viraj",   },   overrides: {     sms: {       customData: {         principalEntityId: "principal entity Id",         dltTemplateId: "dlt template Id",       },     },   }, });    ## Email Editor Variables Auto-suggestion Dropdown  We've made a little adjustment to the workflow email editor to enhance user experience by including auto-suggestions while adding variables.  This feature greatly minimizes the chance of selecting the wrong variable and having incorrect template content.  ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6olmw54gyvffchodsyhj.png)  ## Notable changes  -

## 0.9.12  1. Support Google Reader API and FreshRSS API (#536, @Ashinch) 2. Use forward and backward transition animation (#540, @JunkFood02) 3. Provide option to exclude additional information when exporting to OPML file (#567, @Ashinch) 4. Provide option to gray out starred article items (#547, @MauroGuida) 5. Fix "swipe to mark as read article" (#520, @aeghn) 6. Fix empty group not round bottom corner issue (#529, @kid1412621) 7. Fix refresh view after sync (#531, @kid1412621) 8. Fix error caused by missing article title (#532, @kid1412621) 9. Fix orphaned articles during sync in Fever API (#534, @Ashinch) 10. Many UI improvements and bug fixes (@Ashinch, @JunkFood02) 11. Translations updates (thanks to everyone who helped out)  ### Notes  1. Thanks to the FreshRSS community, especially @Alkarex, for their help with this project. 2. ReadYou is currently not fully compatible with Inoreader through the Google Reader API. 3. ReadYou is currently unable to specify a new group when adding a subscription through the Google Reader API. 4. When syncing with Google Reader API, ReadYou can fetch up to 10k articles per sync. For read articles, only those within the past month will be synced, while unread and starred articles will be fully synced. The sync speed primarily depends on the number of these articles. The initial sync may take some time, depends on the amount of data difference between the local and server. If you have a large number of feeds, it may still feel slow, I can try to optimize this if needed. 5. We recommend that users who have participated in the testing re-sync or re-add their Google Reader API account after installing version `0.9.12`. 6. Let's look forward to more improvements in detail in the next version.  **Full changelog:** [0.9.11...0.9.12](https://github.com/Ashinch/ReadYou/compare/0.9.11...0.9.12)
