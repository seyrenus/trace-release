```
- Crawlee is a web scraping and browser automation library. - [Launching Crawlee for Python blog post](https://crawlee.dev/blog/launching-crawlee-python)  ## Features  Why is Crawlee the preferred choice for web scraping and crawling?  ### Why use Crawlee instead of just a random HTTP library with an HTML parser?  - Unified interface for **HTTP & headless browser** crawling. - Automatic **parallel crawling** based on available system resources. - Written in Python with **type hints** - enhances DX (IDE autocompletion) and reduces bugs (static type checking). - Automatic **retries** on errors or when you’re getting blocked. - Integrated **proxy rotation** and session management. - Configurable **request routing** - direct URLs to the appropriate handlers. - Persistent **queue for URLs** to crawl. - Pluggable **storage** of both tabular data and files. - Robust **error handling**.  ### Why to use Crawlee rather than Scrapy?  - Crawlee has out-of-the-box support for **headless browser** crawling (Playwright). - Crawlee has a **minimalistic & elegant interface** - Set up your scraper with fewer than 10 lines of code. - Complete **type hint** coverage. - Based on standard **Asyncio**.

## What's Changed  - 📦 Official package now available on [__PyPI__][ext-pypi] (#2127) @ppfeister - 📦 Official package now available on [__DockerHub__][ext-dockerhub] (#2216) @ppfeister - 📦 Official package now available on [__Fedora__][ext-fedora] @ppfeister - 📦 Community package now available on [__Homebrew__][ext-homebrew] @p-linnane - ✨ New Sherlock wiki at [__sherlockproject.xyz__][ext-wiki] @sdushantha  - ✨ --dump-response flag added for easier debugging (#2214) @ppfeister - 🪲 Fixed uncaught exception when tor browser not found (#2033) @joaomfbh - 🪲 ‼️ Importable module renamed from sherlock to sherlock_project [__[details]__][ext-deb1072733] @ppfeister - 🛠️ Adopted Poetry and restructured as a true package @mjsir911 @ppfeister @matheusfelipeog @sdushantha - 🛠️ Unit testing rewritten to better support contributors and packagers @ppfeister   - Switched from unittest to pytest and tox   - Expanded regression testing to include builds on Windows and MacOS   - Added offline-only test environments for packagers (see below) - 🛠️ Manifest now uses schema for better regression testing and in-IDE UX (#2212) @ppfeister - 🛠️ Added detection mechanism for users running via legacy/unsupported methods (#2213) @ppfeister - 🛠️ ‼️ Dependency [__torrequest__][ext-torrequest] made optional (#2215) @ppfeister @matheusfelipeog    - --tor and --unique-tor are now DEPRECATED (see detail below) - 🛠️ ‼️ Deprecated support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 (now ^3.8) - 🛠️ Several minor UX improvements over the course of development - 🏷️ Adopted properly tagged releases help out our downstream packagers - ✍️ General improvements to and simplification of in-repo documentation  Manifest contributors this cycle: @RahalBhupathi @abhirai7 @pandyah5 @roxerj @Wicloz @slavran   [__[full changelog]__][release-diff]  ___  #### ‼️ Tor deprecation detail  `--tor` and `--unique-tor` are now deprecated, and both are up for possible removal in a future release (#2200). Users who need time to adapt to this change can install the now-optional dependency [__torrequest__][ext-torrequest]. If Sherlock has been installed via pip, `pip install 'sherlock-project[tor]'` will include the necessary extras  Since torrequest is simply _not available_ as an rpm, those options have already been patched out of the Fedora release.  ___  #### 📦 Packaging info  Many packages are required to be built entirely offline, as with the official Fedora release and the upcoming community-supported Debian release. Sherlock's unit tests generally require an internet connection, but with the adoption of tox and pytest, we've added offline-only test modes.  `tox -e offline` is the preferred offline-only test method, with `pytest -m "not online"` also being supported out of the box. Reference @ppfeister's [__spec file__][ext-rpm-spec] for an example of fully-offline unit testing with tox.  [release-diff]: https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/compare/v0.14.4...v0.15.0  [ext-pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/sherlock-project/ [ext-dockerhub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/sherlock/sherlock [ext-fedora]: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sherlock-project/ [ext-homebrew]: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sherlock  [ext-wiki]: https://sherlockproject.xyz [ext-wiki-install]: https://sherlockproject.xyz/installation  [ext-rpm-spec]: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/sherlock-project/blob/rawhide/f/sherlock-project.spec  [ext-torrequest]: https://pypi.org/project/torrequest/  [ext-deb1072733]: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1072733
