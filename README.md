## ✨ What’s New in v0.9.2? ✨  The most recent release brings some solid new features, enhancements, and bug fixes that should enhance your experience across the platform. Check out what's changed:  ### 🚀 New Features  - **Model Additions and Enhancements:** Added models `qwen2.5-72b` and `llama3.2` for OpenRouter by @hwzhuhao in #8956. Also, `O1-mini`, `O1-preview`, and `LlamaGuard` models have joined the lineup thanks to contributions from @charli117 and @crazywoola.  - **Workflow System Parameters:** Now, you can access `sys.app_id`, `sys.workflow_id`, and `sys.workflow_run_id` in your workflow system variables for more dynamic workflows, courtesy of @ZhouhaoJiang in #9108.  - **Image Generation Enhancements:** The StepFun image generation tool got a boost, enabling richer and broader capabilities, spearheaded by @hwzhuhao in #8954.  - **Tools Update:** Discord Incoming Webhook now lets you send messages directly, created by @yaoice. Props to @hwzhuhao for adding tags for Vanna tools too.  - **Vector Provider:** Meet the new kid on the block, Volcengine VikingDB, integrated into the system and ready to expand your vector capabilities, brought to you by @yaoice in #9287.  - **CSP Support:** Content Security Policy (CSP) is now supported, adding an extra layer of security to your operations, thanks to @douxc.  - **Supabase Object Storage:** A new storage option at your disposal, big cheers to @hwzhuhao for the integration in #9229.  ### ⚙️ Enhancements  - **Richer Time Tool Functions:** Now you can convert and retrieve timestamps with the Time Tool, unlocking more precise temporal operations courtesy of @hwzhuhao.  - **Non-Root User for Web Container:** Security gets a bump with the use of a non-root user in the web container, hats off to @s2oBCN for that.  - **Prompt Editor Optimization:** Clearer and more efficient prompt editing with reset capabilities, devised by @HiChen404.  - **Customizeable Chatbot Embed:** Change the size to fit your needs with default values set for your convenience—well done, @alterxyz for this addition.  - **Responsive Front-end Updates:** With rerank model verification and error logs only in debug mode, your interface just became more practical and informative. Thanks, @YIXIAO0 and @hwzhuhao.  ### 🛠️ Bug Fixes  - **API and Logs:** Chat API now reliably retrieves conversation history (thanks @xuzuodong), and fixes have been applied to API proxy updates and missing model information in LLM spans.  - **Tool Descriptions:** Essential descriptions are back where they belong—visible and complete, thanks to @crazywoola.  - **External Knowledge and Retrievals:** Addressing issues in agent retrieval and entry allows external knowledge operation to run smoother, thanks to @JohnJyong.  - **Miscellaneous Fixes:** Including max-token adjustments in OpenRouter by @infinitnet, correct session history fetching, stopping notification errors, and many more have tightened up the system, courtesy of multiple contributors.  ### Miscellaneous  - **Typos and Documentation:** Corrected typos and added documentation on key integrations like Google Cloud Terraform, thanks to the hawk-eyed @y-omr and @sotazum.  This version packs plenty to explore, ensuring your workflows and integrations are smoother, faster, and richer with features. Happy upgrading!  ---  ## Upgrade Guide  > [!WARNING] > This version includes a migration that might update a large volume of messages.
