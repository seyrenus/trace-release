## 🚀 Release Notes  _Since our last release we've seen an influx of interest, thanks in part to getting posted to Hacker News and elsewhere. Welcome all! We appreciate your interest, questions, filed issues, and support 😄_   This release focuses on a wave of fixes to address some of the user feedback we've received, as well as some targeted features that had been on our backlog for quite some time. Some select highlights:  * Ergonomic improvements to the `brush-core` exported API surface for applications embedding `brush`. _(Particular thanks to @Elsie19 and other contributors on this)_. * Support for logical/physical options (`-L`, `-P`) to `cd`, `pwd`, et al. _(This builds on the work that @39555 started several months back; thanks for your patience until we were able to get to it!)_ * Significant improvements to the `mapfile`/`readarray` builtin. _(Thanks to @Elsie19 on overhauling mapfile's core input loop.)_ * Initial implementation of the `ulimit` builtin. _(Thanks to @lu-zero for getting it from unimplemented to something reasonable.)_ * Initial implementation of `bind -x` support, used by many shell extensions and users' `.bashrc` files; there's more to do, but this covers a long asked-for feature request from the community.  There's plenty more bug fixes and changes -- as usual, the full details are below. And a big shout-out to our new contributors as well as contributors who dove in deeper this cycle! 🙏  ## 🗒️ Details * fix: correct release tag check in cd pipeline by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/443 * feat(apply_unary_predicate_to_str): implement `-R` operand by @Elsie19 in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/439 * feat(Shell): add methods to add environmental variables and builtins by @Elsie19 in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/447 * ref(Shell): turn `&Path` parameters into `AsRef<Path>` by @Elsie19 in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/448 * build(deps): bump taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action from 1.24.0 to 1.25.0 in the github-actions group by @dependabot in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/450 * fix(prompt): support PROMPT_COMMAND arrays by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/451 * fix(trap): handle '-' unregistration syntax by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/452 * test(extended-tests): explicitly set modified date on test files by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/453 * chore: upgrade dependencies: reedline, nix, clap, thiserror, etc. by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/456 * chore: enable (and fix) current checks across all workspace crates by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/457 * feat: implement {cd,pwd} -{L,P} by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/458 * build(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates by @dependabot in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/461 * build(deps): bump the github-actions group with 2 updates by @dependabot in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/460 * fix(complete): fixes + tests for "declare -r" by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/462 * fix: enable unnameable_types lint and mitigate errors by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/459 * fix(builtin): fix issues with 'builtin' invoking declaration builtins by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/466 * fix(declare): turn down volume on non-existent functions by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/467 * fix(expansion): allow negative subscripts with indexed arrays + slices by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/468 * chore: better log + connect unimpl functionality with GH issues by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/476 * chore: separate release and bench profiles by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/477 * test: add compat test for $_ (not yet passing) by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/480 * docs: update readme by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/481 * test: add known failing tests for reported issues by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/483 * feat(builtins): implement basic `bind -x` support by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/478 * fix: allow "bind" usage in .bashrc by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/485 * build(deps): bump the cargo group with 3 updates by @dependabot in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/487 * feat(mapfile): Register also as readarray by @lu-zero in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/486 * fix(expansion): fix issues parsing backquoted commands nested in single/double-quoted strings by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/491 * feat(funcs): implement function exporting/importing by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/492 * fix(break,continue): use `default_value_t` for flag values by @Elsie19 in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/493 * docs: add discord invite to readme by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/494 * chore(edit_mode): Fix clippy lints by @lu-zero in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/495 * fix(help): better compact argument help by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/499 * fix(input): map Ctrl+_ -> undo by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/500 * fix: fix typos + add spell-checking PR check by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/501 * feat(mapfile): implement `-n`, `-d`, `-s` by @Elsie19 in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/490 * Implement ulimit by @lu-zero in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/482 * docs(readme): a Fish as a shell implemented in Rust by @brettcannon in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/505 * chore: prepare release by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/504 * fix: add missing tokio feature to unblock release by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/506 * fix: suppress warning when building with --no-default-features by @reubeno in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/508  ## New Contributors * @brettcannon made their first contribution in https://github.com/reubeno/brush/pull/505  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/reubeno/brush/compare/brush-shell-v0.2.17...brush-shell-v0.2.18
