```
In this version, 2 main features were added:  - **1. GPU support**    - The back-end GPU kernels are managed by the `gpu.js` library.    - To add a Tensor to the gpu, pass 'gpu' as the `device` argument.    - To add a whole layer (`nn.Linear`, `nn.Block`, `nn.MultiHeadSelfAttention`) to the gpu, , pass 'gpu' as the `device` argument.    - The syntax is just like the PyTorch counterpart.  -  **2. Saving and Loading models**     - The functions are `torch.save` and `torch.load`.     - The functionality is explained on the README.md file.

## 更新日志  **注意**：本次升级涉及较大配置文件变动。推荐在备份好原配置文件后删除旧文件，并根据新的 example 配置文件重新编写配置。如果未进行变更，系统会将配置文件进行备份，使用默认配置进行扫描。  ---  ### 修复问题  1. **修复 Ctrl-C 无法中断扫描的问题**：     - 修复了在扫描过程中按 Ctrl-C 无法中断操作的问题，提升用户体验。  ### 优化改进  1. **优化 debug 输出内容**：     - 改进了调试信息的输出格式，使信息更加明确和美观，便于调试和排查问题。  2. **提高扫描性能，降低内存占用**：     - 修复 go html 库的 maxbuf 配置未导出导致的可能存在的内存溢出问题。     - 为响应数据的图标和标题增加了缓存机制，提升处理效率。     - 增加 HTML 解析的最大长度限制，防止解析过长数据导致的问题。     - 修复上游正则库中的垃圾回收（GC）问题，提升系统稳定性。     - 优化插件执行效率，使扫描过程更为高效。     - 优化缓存机制，减少内存使用量。  ### 新增功能  1. **新增 example 配置文件，减少非常用配置变更带来的冲突问题**：     - 新版本 xray 2.0 系列工具会创建一个 example 文件，不再创建默认配置文件。用户可以复制 example 文件并去掉 example 后缀，然后修改其中内容。  2. **YAML 插件变化**：     - 新增 `print` 函数：方便在调试场景下打印信息。     - 新增 `uuid` 函数：支持生成随机的 UUID。     - 新增 `format` 函数：支持格式化字符串，可以通过指定对齐字符、前缀和步进参数来调整字符串的显示样式。     - 新增 `bload` 函数：支持将字符串数据按照特定编码规则转换为字节序列。     - 新增 `gzip` 函数：支持对字符串或字节序列数据进行 GZIP 压缩。     - 新增 `decToHex` 函数：支持将十进制转换为十六进制。     - 在 YAML 插件中，定义变量时，下划线开头的变量将不会输出：         - 这样在输出时，JSON 中不会包含某些不希望输出的变量值。     - 增强 YAML 插件的鲁棒性，支持在函数中填写不同数据类型。所有只能填写字符串或字节的数据项，两者都可以填写，不再报错。     - 支持函数调用和方法调用两种方式，即 `func(v1,v2)` 和 `v1.func(v2)` 均可，不再报错。     - 修复 `icon` 函数，使其行为逻辑与 `getIconContent` 函数保持一致。     - udp/tcp的request支持获取addrType类型的参数  3. **支持在未配置的情况下调用 dnslog.cn 进行漏洞检测**：     - 新增对 dnslog.cn 的支持，即使未进行相关配置也能使用该服务进行漏洞检测。  ### 其他改进  1. **修复缓存和不合理的超时配置导致的扫描结果不稳定问题**：     - 改进缓存机制和超时配置，解决因配置不当导致的扫描结果不稳定问题。  2. **为 group 命令添加 path 约定**：     - 为 `group` 命令添加路径约定，以便使用 `group` 文件的相对路径。在 `group` 中使用 `{{path}}` 将用 `group` 文件本身的路径替换该内容。  3. **新特性：多目标输入支持多个 -t 参数**：     - 取消多目标输入时使用逗号分隔的方式，改为支持以多个 `-t` 输入多个目标，因为 URL 中可能存在逗号，避免冲突。
